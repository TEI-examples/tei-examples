            <p>We assume three levels of punning (<foreign>śleṣa</foreign>) in the first stanza. The
               first two play on the possibility of taking <foreign>śaktibhṛt</foreign> either
               literally, or as epithet of the war-god Skanda; on the possibility of interpreting
               <foreign>abhī</foreign> in two different ways; and on the different possibilities of analyzing the
               compound <foreign>adaṇḍabhedā</foreign>. The third sense may be less obvious to most
               readers. But in a footnote in the Preface to his edition of the
                  <bibl><ref target="cic-bibl:goodall-2004"><title>Parākhyatantra</title></ref> (<biblScope>p. xix, n. 17</biblScope>), Dominic Goodall</bibl> has discussed Śaiva
               punning on the words <foreign>śakti</foreign> (spear or power, of king, Skanda or Śiva) and
                  <foreign>ari</foreign> (enemies, worldly or internal) in a late-7th-century
               inscription of Pallava king <persName type="king">Narasiṃha II</persName>. He has
               there provided textual references in support of taking <foreign>arivarga</foreign>
               ‘group of enemies’ as denoting the human senses or passions (a theme also alluded to in <ref target="C0173.xml">C. 173</ref>), and referred to a passage
               illustrating the (descent of) divine power (<foreign>śaktipāta</foreign>) as crucial element in Śaiva tantric initiation.
            </p>
               <p>In further support of the assumption of this third sense, he has shared with us his
               interpretation of a stanza in a somewhat later inscription. This is K. 528 (Eastern
               Mebon, 953 CE, edited in <bibl><ptr target="cic-bibl:finot-1925"/>: <biblScope>309–352</biblScope></bibl>), stanza XX, about King Rājendravarman, and it comprises
               three crucial elements that we also see in ours:

               <!-- ARLO: not sure how to encode the cited verse and its translation -->
                Mahendra is both the name of King Rājendravarman's father, Mahendravarman, and a name of the god Indra, whose enemies Skanda destroyed.  So there must here be a reference to Skanda getting hold of (<foreign>āsādya</foreign>) his famous weapon, called Śakti (though not always clearly a spear), and destroying Indra's enemies (which was the reason for his birth being plotted by Indra in the first place).  Most words can be accounted for in that layer of meaning, but the words <foreign>māheśvarīṃ jñānamayīm</foreign> defy multivalent interpretation, and <foreign>vibudhopanītāṃ</foreign> suggests that he gained his famous weapon from the gods. There is almost certainly a myth that recounts such a handover, but we have not been able to find it.  What we do find is that Viśvakarman is said to have fashioned Guha's Śakti using bits of radiance of the sun (in <ref><seg type="check">Viṣṇupurāṇa</seg> 3.2.12</ref>), 
                  <!-- AG how to deal with primary sources in bibliography? -->
                  and that certainly suggests that some god must then have handed it to him. What is plain is that in one level of meaning the verse refers to Rājendravarman, like Prakāśadharman, having received Śiva’s salvific grace (<foreign>śakti</foreign>), in other words tantric initiation. </p>
            <p>Our new reading <foreign>s<supplied reason="lost">v</supplied>apitāmahīpitur</foreign> makes Kandarpadharman the father of Prakāśadharman’s paternal grandmother (rather than the father of his paternal great-grandmother).</p>
