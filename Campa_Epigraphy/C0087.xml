                    <p>IX. When this Sun here rises, the Moon sets; and when that Moon rises, the Sun sets: this is normally the situation in the world.

                <p>X. Īśāna here, who cannot be cut, who cannot be split, who is primordial, who heals the misery (<foreign>kṣata</foreign>) of all his followers here below, himself, with his body damaged, pronounced this, which is to be proclaimed by the competent: the king Vikrāntavarman, having covered that damaged [<foreign>liṅga</foreign>], which is specially desired by Īśāna, (although he) has eight manifestations<note>On the eight manifestations of Śiva (which are different from the eight names listed by A.-V.

                <p>XI. … shines, breaking forth from Īśāna's silver sheath (which emits white rays of light), like the mountain of sunrise being shrouded by lightning. [The white light] is the fame of the king Prakāśadharman!<note>There is probably a pun here on the name Prakāśadharman, which contains the word <foreign>prakāśa</foreign> meaning 'radiance'. But the lacuna in the text prevents us from understanding the exact significance of the poet's choice of words here. As it stands, our translation is based on the assumption that the image of the comparison lies in the sun, comparable to the <foreign>liṅga</foreign>'s crown, being on top of the mountain (comp. to the <foreign>liṅga</foreign>), surrounded by lightning (comp. to the silver sheath or its rays of white light). Fame is usually regarded as white in Sanskrit poetry, so that it should be compared to the rays of the silver sheath, not to the light of the golden crown. The lacuna would, we suppose, have contained an expression for Śiva with his golden crown. The Śiva in the <foreign>liṅga</foreign> is of course invisible to the common eye but can be visualized by meditation.</note></p>
