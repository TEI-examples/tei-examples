<head>Act 1st</head>
<stage>
Scene 1st--	A quiet valley at the foot of
the Hartz Mountains.  Cottage of Dame Barbara
R. H.  3rd Ent. with practicable upper window 
and balcony.  Set tree beside cottages, at back 
Set arbor L.H.  3rd ent. Broken water and 
 rustic stone bridge or long rocky trail
piece with platform from R to L backed 
by an extended range of hills or mountain spurs
above which light clouds appear, 
illuminated by the reflected light 
of the moon.  Shortly after rise of curtain the moonbeams grow faint and the ruddy 
glow of the rising sun diffuses itself over the clouds and horizon. 
</stage>
<stage>
MUSIC at rise of curtain--enter 
Rodolphe, at back, R. H.  He descends, comes 
forward and after looking cautiously 
around claps his hands three times beneath 
the window.  The upper window opens 
and Amina appears on balcony.
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p>
Surely I heard his well-known signal.  
Hist, who&#39;s there?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Tis I, Rodolphe!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Rodolphe!  Hush speak low, if my foster
mother still sleeps, I will join you. <stage>(retires.)</stage>  
</p></sp>
<stage>
(Music.  Rodolphe goes upstage and 
looks cautiously off, then comes down --
Amina enters from cottage.)
</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<stage>
(Throwing herself into his arms)</stage><p>Rodolphe!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
My own!
</p></sp>
<pb/>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
When did you return?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
&#39;Twas past midnight:  although wearied and 
footsore I could not sleep until I had seen 
you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Oh, how wearily the days and nights have 
passed since you left me!  What kept you 
so long?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Ill fortune, Amina.  After reaching Gottingen
and finding no purchaser for my picture 
I heard that there was a wealthy traveller 
at Cassel, collecting works of art.  
I had but four silver florins in my 
pocket yet I hopefully set out to meet 
him.  After journeying five whole days 
I arrived at Cassel only to find that the 
traveller had departed two days before.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
And your beautiful picture -- upon which 
so much of our future was built -- you 
have brought it back?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
No.  Crushed in my last hope to obtain 
the means necessary to our union I 
left it with a remorseless agent for a 
pittance barely sufficient for subsistence 
during my journey homeward, and here 
I am without a single guilder in my pocket! And what is worse if I fail to redeem 
my pledge at the end of two months it 
is lost to me forever.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
<stage>(Aside)</stage> Poor, dear Rodolphe, he knows not 
the worst--the heaviest blow is yet to come, How shall I break it to him? <stage>(Aloud)</stage> Dear 
Rodolphe, my great joy at seeing you 
made me forget for a moment that which 
I fear to tell you.</p></sp>
<stage>
(The moonlight begins to fade and the horizon 
grow ruddy with the rising sun.)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Fear to tell me!  Speak, what has happened?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Be calm and listen.  Last week I attended 
the festival of St. John, in company 
with the other members of the village 
choir.  Upon raising my eyes after we 
had finished the anthem I found a 
dark, strange man gazing upon me.  
A moment after he quitted the spot 
I enquired who he was and learned that 
it was the Count Wolfenstein, the all
powerful lord of this wide domain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Although I met his gaze but for a moment, 
I felt that it boded evil to me--to <emph rend="underline"> us</emph>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Evil!  Evil to <emph rend="underline"> us</emph>?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Yes, evil, Rodolphe, nor were my fears 
idle, the next day brought him here to 
our humble abode--he told my foster-
mother that he loved me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<stage>(Starting)</stage> Loved!--You?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Yes, and that we should no longer dwell in 
obscurity--that we should be removed to the 
castle--that masters should be provided for 
my suitable education, and in a year 
I should take the place of the late Countess 
of Wolfenstein.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
And dame Barbara?----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Joyfully consented.  This very day is set 
apart for our removal.  The escort will 
be here at sunrise.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
And you, Amina, You?---</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
I supplicated, wept, remonstrated, but you 
know, dear Rodolphe, I am powerless.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p><stage>
(Vehemently)</stage> By Heaven, you shall not go.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Hush, be calm, dear Rodolphe.</p></sp>
<stage>
(Dame Barbara appears on the balcony)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
I say you shall not!  Were he twenty 
times more potent I would oppose his 
power to the last.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Eh, what, varlet, hussey, only wait till 
I get down! <stage>(MUSIC she disappears 
from balcony and enters from door--)</stage>
What, jade, ingrate!  how dare you?  
Is this your gratitude?  Where is your 
pride?  Now, the most noble Countess 
of Wolfenstein that is to be meeting 
young men in secret and on the very 
day of your bethrothal.  Oh, if his high
mightiness the Count should find it out!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>

But mother --</p></sp>
<pb/>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Not a word-- how dare you?  In with you, 
into the house, I say! <stage>(Forces her into the 
cottage, closes the door, then turns to 
Rodolphe)</stage> So, beggar, you&#39;ve come back
have you?  How dare you show your 
unlucky face here at such a time as 
this!  I had hoped you had fallen into 
the hands of the conscript officers and
gone for a soldier, or better still, been 
carried off by the demons of the Brocken.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
 And yet you see I&#39;ve escaped both.  
Hark ye, dame.  I love Amina, she 
loves me, you yourself promised that 
she should be mine as soon as I could 
command a hundred silver crowns.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
Barbara
</speaker><p>
 Pah, that was before I knew her value, but 
now that I <emph rend="underline"> do</emph> know it and others know it 
too, I&#39;ve changed my mind.  But where 
are the hundred crowns?--Where&#39;s the for-
tune you were to get for your great pain-
ting?  I warrant me you haven&#39;t got a 
single groschen of it.  Come, let me see the 
hundred crowns.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
My picture is not yet sold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Ha, ha!  Didn&#39;t I say so,  not yet sold
eh?  Here&#39;s a pretty fellow, that would 
take a young girl from her comfortable
home, a good bed, sweet milk and 
egg-pudding, to lodge her on pea-straw, 
and feed her at best on black bread and 
sour cheese.  Oh, was there ever such villainy?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Nay, but listen to me.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>
Barbara</speaker><p>
Not a word; begone, do you think people of 
quality have nothing to do but listen to 
beggars complaints, and above all at such 
a time as this?  Begone, I say, this is 
to be a festival day, the maidens of the 
village will be here anon; the grand escort 
will be here, headed by the Count&#39;s chamberlain,  
Aye, and his Lordship the Count 
himself will be here, to bear the Countess 
that <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> to be and her right honorable 
foster-mother that <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> to be to the Castle.
<stage>(Music)</stage> Hark, here come the villagers 
already:  Out of the way I say.</p></sp>
<stage>
(Pushes him rudely aside, goes up and 
looks off RH--Rodolphe retires into 
the arbor.)</stage>
<stage>
(Enter lively from RH at back, female 
villagers with garlands, followed by males, 
two of whom bear a rustic chair, festooned 
with flowers.  They descend and come 
forward, greeting the Dame.  Females LH 
males RH at back.  The sun appears 
above one of the spurs of the Mountains.)
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Down RH)</stage> Ah, you are early, friends.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Yes, but not earlier than the sun, for see, 
it is already peeping over the great toe 
of the Brocken.  But where&#39;s Amina?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>
Barbara
</speaker><p>
<stage>(Drawing herself up)</stage>
 The Countess that <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> to 
be is preparing to receive his lordship the 
Count.  But never mind her ladyship, 
enjoy yourselves until she is ready.  Here, 
Casper, here I am, come with me and bring 
some refreshments while I help to prepare 
her ladyship <stage>(Goes into the cottage 
followed by Casper and Jan. The two latter 
re-enter with white cloth, wine, fruits,
etc.  which they arrange on the table 
beneath the tree)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Bless me, how grand Dame Barbara has 
grown, to be sure.  If she goes on at this 
rate the wide halls of the grand old
Castle of Wolfenstein will be a world 
too small to hold her.  I hope this 
piece of good fortune will not make 
such a fool of dear &#39;Mina
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>
Rosetta
</speaker><p>
I don&#39;t understand this, I thought &#39;Mina 
was bethrothed to the handsome young 
painter Rodolphe,  what ever could 
have become of him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Oh, &#39;tis said he has gone for a soldier-- 
But come, while &#39;Mina is making 
ready let us rehearse our Festival Dance.</p></sp>
<stage>
(Music: Grand Garland Dance 
by principals and full Ballet, during 
which the Males gather around the table 
and eat and drink.  After dance, Barbara
re-enters extravagantly dressed, wearing a 
monstrous cap ridiculously trimmed)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
There!  Having completed her ladyships 
toilet I have attended to my own, and, 
if I know anything about dress, I flatter 
myself that my appearance would do 
honor to any occasion. <stage> (Displays herself)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<stage>(Aside to Rosetta)</stage><p>Mercy on us, was there 
ever such a fright!  Why she looks for 
all the world like a great horned owl 
dressed up in the cast-off finery of 
a peacock.  Ha, ha, ha,  Did you ever? 
Observe me tickle the old buzzard.
<stage>(Aloud and with affected admiration)</stage>
Why! Dame Barbara, is that you?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Drawing herself up)</stage>Of course it is, child.  
Who else should it be?<stage>(Aside)</stage> I knew 
I should make them open their eyes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Why you&#39;ve almost taken away my 
breath.  I declare, Dame, you&#39;re looking 
gorgeous--so young and girlish too.  
Indeed, if I were &#39;Mina--I beg pardon 
I mean her ladyship, I wouldn&#39;t 
care to have you in the way when 
his lordship, the Count, arrives.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
And why not, pray?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
 Because I should consider you a 
dangerous rival.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Nonesense, girl, you don&#39;t think so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Indeed, Dame Barbara, I was never more 
serious in my life. <stage>(Laughingly confers 
with Rosetta and villagers)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>

It&#39;s strange I never noticed it before, but 
that girl Carline&#39;s a very sensible person.
<stage>(Music)</stage> Ah, here comes the escort!
</p></sp>
<stage>
(All go up and look off RH.  RODOLPHE glides 
from the arbor into the cottage unobserved.)</stage>
<stage>
	ENTER from RH at back, and descending 
Von Puffengruntz, bearing the wand of office, 
He is preceeded by two servants of the 
Count&#39;s household, as he comes down the 
Male Villagers take off their caps and the 
females curtsey</stage>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>

<stage>(LH, With pompous condescension)</stage> Be 
covered, good people, be covered; the air of 
the valley is yet damp.  We never insist 
upon ceremony at the expense of health.
<stage>(Aside)</stage> Ahem It is the true policy of 
greatness to occasionally waive a point 
of etiquette in dealing with inferiors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
What a courtly gentleman!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
What an imposing female!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Curtseying)</stage> Your Excellency is welcome.
Von Puff <stage>(Bowing)</stage> I cannot be mistaken, I was just 
about to inquire, but that stately presence 
and graceful dignity tell me that I am 
addressing Madam Barbara.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Curtseying)</stage> Oh, sir. <stage>(Aside)</stage> How one&#39;s 
manner will betray one, I always said I 
belonged to a higher sphere.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
I come, Madam, by the Count&#39;s order to announce 
that the cavalcade has arrived and is now 
resting on the plateau, beyond the ravine.
His lordship will be here presently and in 
person conduct your fair foster daughter
to her palfrey, that waits without, impatient 
for the honor to be mounted by her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Curtseying)</stage> Oh, sir, his lordship is so considerate.  
But may I inquire if <emph rend="underline"> I</emph> have 
been thought of?  And I <emph rend="underline"> also</emph> to be provided 
with a becoming escort?  Is there any palfrey 
without impatient for the honor to be ridden 
by me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
That shall be my privilege
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Astonished)</stage> Eh!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
That is I have charged myself with the 
especial honor of being your escort.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Curtseying very low)</stage> Oh! <stage>Music</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
He comes!  Room there for his lordship.</p></sp>
<stage>
(Villagers range themselves to receive 
the COUNT who enters RH at back, 
crosses and comes down LH preceeded by 
guards and followed by Wulfgar and 
Bruno.  When down Villagers shout 
and wave their caps)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker><p>Salutation to the good dame Barbara.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Curtesying very low)</stage> Oh, your lordship!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker><p>And how fares your lovely charge?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Well, may it please your lordship, quite 
well, a little nervous from over-anxiety to 
see your lordship, but that is quite natural 
with us poor silly things.  I suffered 
<emph rend="underline"> dreadfully</emph> in that way when my poor 
dear, dead and gone Christopher courted me.  
Many and many a time---</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker><p><stage>(Impatiently interrupting her)</stage> But the fair Amina,</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Is quite ready and dying to see you--I will present her to 
your lordship at once.</p></sp>
<stage>	She is going into the cottage when 
Rodolphe appears and comes forward, leading 
Amina by the hand (CHORD)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Allow <emph rend="underline">me</emph> dame Barbara, to do the honors.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>
All the Villagers
</speaker><p>
Rodolphe! <stage>(Picture of astonishment)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
My lord Count Wolfenstein, permit me, 
Rodolphe Werner, a poor artist, to present 
to you Amina, foster-daughter to dame 
Barbara, a free maiden of the valley and 
my affianced bride.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker><p>
Who is this madman?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
N-n-n-n-n-n-nobody, your Lordship, that is
a poor, weak simpleton who imagines he 
is betrothed to every girl in the village.  
As your lordship <emph rend="underline"> truly</emph> says, a madman.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
A madman!  Mercy on us, we shall all 
be murdered.  Seize him, secure him, somebody, 
everybody.</p></sp>
	<stage>(MUSIC  Wulfgar and 
Bruno seize Rodolphe and after a struggle 
overpower him.  Amina screams, clings to 
him for a moment then throws herself at 
the Counts feet, he raises and passes her 
to Barbara, then turns to guards)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker><p>
Release him, <stage>(They release him)</stage> His misfortune 
claims our pity.  Let some of his fellows conduct 
him hence and see that no harm come 
to him. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<stage>(Defiantly)</stage> My Lord Count---</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker><p>
Begone, Sirrah!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Casper</speaker><p>Come, Rodolphe, come with me. <stage>(aside)</stage> Are 
you indeed mad to brave the tiger in his 
lair--<stage>(Leads him RH)</stage> Come I say, this is 
neither time nor place to right your wrong.  
Be calm, I say, be calm.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<stage>(Shaking him by the hand)</stage> You are right, 
Casper, you are right. <stage> (Looks scornfully 
at Wolfenstein)</stage> Come, my friend, come.
<stage>(Exit RH 1st Ent. with Casper)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p> &#39;Tis he, the lover.  He braves me, too.</p>
<stage>(Aloud)</stage> <p>Wulgar!</p> <stage>(Wulfgar advances)</stage>
<stage>(Apart to Wulfgar)</stage><p> Track younder knave, take 
Bruno with you.  Seize him, but let no 
eye see you,  Place him in the secret vault 
beneath the eastern wing.  Once there--you 
know the rest.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wulfgar</speaker><p><stage>(Nods meaningly)</stage> I understand.  <stage>(Gives sign 
to Bruno and is going RH 1st Ent)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker><p>
Stay, not now, it will be noted.  When the procession 
moves then steal away by the upper path</p></sp>
<stage>
(Wulfgar nods, turns upstage and 
confers with Bruno.  Wolfenstein confers
with Von Puffengruntz at back.)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>
(Leading Amina forward and aside to her)
</stage>
Silence, on your life, not a word that you 
have ever seen him before.  If the Count were 
to know---Mercy on me, I tremble to think 
of it, there wouldn&#39;t be a head left on 
any of our shoulders.</p></sp>
	<stage>(Birds heard singing till scene 
closes)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
<stage>(Waving his wand)</stage> Let the procession move.</p></sp>

Wolfenstein joins Amina, Villagers bring 
foward the festooned chair from LHUE.  
Wolfenstein assists Amina into the seat.  
The chair is borne by four villagers.  The

beside the chair, Von Puffengruntz pompously 
leading Barbara by the hand.

<p>Vain, vain, some subtile spell is 
hovering in the air that mocks my power 
and makes the charms that once were potent 
a jabbering idle sound.  And shall I yield 
to this Invisible?  I, Hertzog, the Crook, whom 
men call sorcerer.  I, at whose name the 
strong man trembles and the weak grows 
faint.  I whose life of long, laborious 
years hath well nigh run its course, gleaning 
dark knowledge in forbidden paths,  
shall I now seek the light?  My eyes 
are old and dim and could not brave the 
glare.  No, no, I&#39;ll work new mines--new 
mines, and plumb the depths of darker 
mysteries still.</p></sp>

Snore?  Aye, granted, but &#39;twas in <emph rend="underline"> thy</emph> service, 
master, much fasting and long 
watching caused this left rebellious eye

again.  </p></sp><sp>

Mercy on us, what a crash!  But pshaw, why hsould I care how

among all the girls in the village to become Amina&#39;s companion 
and own particular waiting maid.  Old Hagar, the gypsy fortune 
teller whose palm I crossed with a new quarter florin 
last week told me that good fortune awaited me, and sure enough, 
here it is.  Only to think of it, that I, Carline 
Brenner , who for ten long years have been chained to a stupid

Why am I summoned?

My life is waining.  Give me to live, feed the still currents 
of my sluggish veins, give me fresh charms and potencies.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>
Wherefore?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Herzog</speaker><p>
Men hate and did they not fear--would despise me.  I would 
repay their hate with hate.  I would live on, on, and in that 
life rival thy dread power of evil.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>
What wilt thou give for such a boon?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Herzog</speaker><p>
Whate&#39;er thou wilt; give me but life and all I have is thine.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>
&#39;tis not enough.  What&#39;s thine is mine already.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Herzog</speaker><p>
What else?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>
Listen.  A soul younger, fresher, whiter than thine, must 
on each recurring year be, by your arts, turned to my account.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Herzog</speaker><p>
I hear, dread master, and will pay the price.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>For every soul thus lost to good and gained to me a year&#39;s
new life is thine.  A single soul, a single year, a hundred 
souls, a hundred years.  &#39;Tis with thyself to live forever.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Herzog</speaker><p>Forever?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>
Forever!  But should the stroke of midnight fall a twelve-month
hence and no lost soul, by you betrayed within that 
time, come wailing at my gates-- perdition closes on your dark 
career.  Is&#39;t a compact?

<sp><speaker>Wulfgar</speaker><p>There my fine fellow.  I think you&#39;re both safe and comfortable.  
No entreaties; neither light nor sound ever comes 
here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Wretch.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wulfgar</speaker><p>When you want exercise or change of air and you can manage 
to get out of yonder little incumbrances-
<stage>(Pointing to chains)</stage>
- you can take it in the vault beneath.  Yonder trap leads 
to it.  You may find it a little mouldy, and may stumble 
over the skeleton of the last lodger, but that&#39;s nothing.  
Any change is better than no change at all. 
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Monster, begone.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wulfgar</speaker><p>(Taking up lamp)
Oh certainly, anything to oblige.  In the meantime, if your 
exercise should give you an appetite and you should want 
food, cry out for it.  Cry loud and I won&#39;t come.  Ha, ha ha.  
Goodnight.</p></sp>
<stage>
(Exits RH door.  Lights down)
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Alone.  So ends in darkness and in death all my bright dreams 
of the future and must I perish thus--I who have but entered 
the portal of life?  No, no, it cannot be!  I must, I will 
burst these bonds.
<stage>(MUSIC.  He makes an effort to break the chains)</stage>
&#39;Tis vain, they defy even the strength of despair.
<stage>(Shuddering)</stage>
How awful is the chill of this noxious vault.  Its very vapors 
press upon my brow like the hand of death and freeze my very 
marrow.<stage>
(MUSIC.  HERTZOG enters with dark lantern through 
sliding panel on LH flat)</stage>
<stage>(STARTING)</stage>
Who&#39;s there?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Thy friend.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Who are you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>(Turning light upon himself)
Behold!
<stage>
(CHORD)
</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<stage>(Starting)</stage>
Hertzog, the Crook!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Aye, so men call me.
<stage>(Puts lantern off LH2)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Ill-omened bird, what brings <emph rend="underline"> you</emph> here?  Yet why should I ask?
You come the minister of death?  &#39;tis well, &#39;tis merciful.
Begin your work.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Out, foolish boy.  I serve no human master.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Then why are you here?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>I come to give thee liberty.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Liberty!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Aye.  Listen.  I hate thine enemy.  Thou lov&#39;st a maid of whom 
thou hast been robbed; would&#39;st win her back?  I have the 
power to serve thee.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Begone, tempter.  I know your power and can gues sfrom whence it 
comes.  Men say you deal in dark and necromantic spells 
that warp the senses and enthrall the soul.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Pah!  Art thou, too, tainted with the vulgar fear that calls 
philosophy-the natural working of great Nature&#39;s laws- a spell 
of darkness?  It is the light, weak boy, the light, which we 
sage men, who waste our lives oe&#39;r midnight lamps, glean from 
dull vapors for the sluggards&#39; use.  Fools sneer the most 
when least they understand and brand as foul what Nature stamps 
as fair.  Thy gains gall theee, let me loose them.
<stage>(He touches them with his staff; they fall to ground)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<stage>(Coming forward)</stage>
What is your purpose?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Again I say to serve thee.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
How?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Listen, I will tell thee a seceret.  She whom thou lovest is 
of noble birth.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Amina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Aye, yet not Amina, but the only child and heiress of the 
noble house of Wellenstein, stolen when but an infant by a 
revengeful gypsy whom her father scourged and given to gabbling 
Barbara.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Amina noble?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Aye, and thou of humble birth, but gold can buy nobility--
nay more, can give thee power to cross thine enemy.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Why talk to me of gold-to me, the poorest of the poor, whose 
purse contains not half so much as one poor silver mark.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Thou&#39;rt poor indeed, but thou art poor because thou <emph rend="underline"> wilt</emph> be 
poor.  &#39;Tis with thyself to shame the wealth of the mighty Croesus.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
How?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Hast thou not heard of glittering gold in massive piles fast 
locked within these mountains?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
An idle tale, a senseless fable told by croning gossips. 
A treasure often sought but never found and some do say &#39;tis
death to seek it. 
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>I tell thee, boy, the story&#39;s true, this gold is palpable to 
sight and touch, and mayt be garnered too, if thou art bold 
enough.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
I&#39;ll hear no more!  Thou&#39;dst take advantage of my desperate 
strait to work some juggle to entrap my soul.  Begone I say, 
begone!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>And leave thee to thy doom?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Aye.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>And thy affianced bride--would&#39;st thou so like a graven yield 
her up onto thine enemy?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Oh, agony!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>&#39;tis true she loves thee, but bethink thee, boy, she is but 
woman and she may be won.  Her noble birth is known to Wolfenstein 
who means to wed her, and with her fortune to prop his 
falling house.  Already flattered by his serpent tounge, she 
dries her tears and listens to his suit.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis false!
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis true!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
The proof?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
Behold.
</p></sp>
<stage>
(MUSIC.  He waves his staff; panel in upper part of RH 
flat slides open, showing through gauze WOLFENSTEIN &amp; 
AMINA, the former clasping the hand and kneeling at the 
feet of the latter whose face is averted.  Picture strongly
lighted)

By Heaven, he shall not!

<stage>

Bravely said!  Bravely said!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p><stage>
(Turning quickly)</stage>
What dev&#39;lish compact would you have me sign?  Propose it 
while my reason whirls and desperation aids your dam&#39;d design. 
If by the act I snatch her from his grasp, I&#39;ll pay the ransom 
though it reach my soul.<stage>
(HERTZOG with face averted chuckles sardonically)</stage>
Come, philosopher or fiend, whate&#39;er thou art; the price, I 
say, the price. 
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
Pah!  I ask no compact.  I would serve thee gratis.  I but 
demand that thou shalt serve thyself.  Be rich and thou&#39;lt be 
powerful.  In thy revenge upon thine enemy and <emph rend="underline"> mine</emph>, thou&#39;lt
pay thy debt to me with interest.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p> 
Where lies this wondrous treasure?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
Listen.  Amid the fastnesses of the Hartz beyond the outlet 
of the Black Gorge lies a small lake whose waters few have 
ever gazen upon, for vulgare fear and superstitious dread have 
long since marked it for enchanted ground.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
I&#39;ve heard the story.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
Trace carefully its northern shore until a rock rising like 
a wall bars further passage beneath a fringe of tangled vines 
you&#39;ll find a boat concealed.  Behold this talisman ring!
<stage>
(Takes a large ring from his finger)
</stage>
&#39;Tis a magnet of wondrous power.  When thou hast found the 
boat step boldly in.  This ring will guide thee safely to the 
entrance of the goldern cavern within the compass of whose 
glittering walls thy wondering eyes may feast on wealth far 
greater than the coffers of the world can boast.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Give me the ring.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis thine.
<stage> (Gives ring)</stage>
Stay, thou&#39;lt need a henchman.
<stage> (Stamps his foot)</stage>
Varlet, come forth.
<stage> (MUSIC.  Panel on LH flat opens as before &amp; GREPPO enters)</stage>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
He too shall perish.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Your will, Master?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
To part with three.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
Oh, if this should be true.
<stage>(Aloud)</stage>
With me?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
With thee, knave.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Wherefore?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
I weary with thine appetite.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p><stage>
(Aside)</stage>
Here&#39;s a chance.  Oh here <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> a chance if he but stick to it.
I must seem unwilling lest he repent.
<stage>(Aloud)</stage>
Dear master, I will reform, believe me, I will reform.  Allowance 
me to what would starve a mouse.  Nay more, to pleasure 
you, I will not eat at all.  I&#39;ll live on air, but do not cast 
me off.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
I am resolved.  Behold thy future master.
<stage>(To Rodolphe)</stage>
Thou&#39;lt find him faithful but he breeds a famine.  Take for 
the present need this purse of gold.
<stage>(Offers purse; RODOLPHE by a gesture refuses it)></stage>
Nay, when thou&#39;rt rich thou canst repay it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p><stage>
(Taking purse)</stage>
Nay, more, if what you say be true, eternal gratitude---
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
Pah, you trifle time.
<stage>(Moves staff; panel opens)</stage>
Yonder lies your path; it is a glorious one.  Begone.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Farewell.  Come, boy, come.

</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
<stage>
(Stands in opening and chuckling gazes after them)</stage>
The thought of vegeance stirs within his heart; the lust of 
gold is rising in his soul, the path that leads to where &#39;tis 
hoarded ends in death.  He&#39;s mine, ha, ha!  He&#39;s mine.

Scene:		A lobby in the castle of Wolfenstein.  Enter
			BARBARA RH, followed by CARLINE.
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Don&#39;t talk to me, girl.  Remember your station and consider 
mine.  Who Am I and what am I that I should be lodged in a 
wing of the castle overlooking the dog kennels.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Your ladyship is quite right to revel and when I advised your 
ladyship to calm yourself it was out of consideration for 
your ladyship&#39;s eyes.  Any little flurry does so spoil the 
natural beauty of their expression.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Carline, you&#39;re a good girl, you&#39;re a considerate girl and I 
forgive you, but eyes or no eyes, I&#39;ll not be imposed upon.
Where&#39;s Mynheer Von Puffengruntz?  Where&#39;s his lordship&#39;s 
chamberlain?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
<stage>(Looking LH)</stage>
Here he comes down the great stairway as full of flesh and 
scant of breath as ever.
<stage> 
(Aside)</stage>
And as the waddling old porpoise appears to have a liquorice 
tooth for this silly old buzzard I&#39;ll leave them to bill and 
coo while I run off to comfort dear &#39;Mina who has passed the 
whole night in tears for poor Rodolphe.</p></sp>
<stage>
(VON PUFF enters LH.  CARLINE curtseys and exits LH)
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Eh, what!  Madam Barbara, stirring so early!  Why, bless my 
soul, the mist of the mountain is yet hanging upon the turrets 
of the castle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Then let it hang and be hanged to it.  Stirring indeed!  Haven&#39;t 
I been stirring all night and wouldn&#39;t the seven sleepers have 
been stirring all night too, if they had lodged where I did?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Surely nothing has had the audacity to disturb the quiet of 
your chamber?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Nothing?  To begin with, do you call such a storm as that of 
last night nothing?  Why the thunder creashed over the castle 
loud enough to wake the dead.  That was bad enough, but only 
to think that I, the right honorable foster mother that <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> 
to be to her right honorable ladyship that <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> to be passing 
the night in apartments overlooking a dog-kennel.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
A dog-kennel?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Aye, a kennel of great, savage hounds, fed late at night on 
raw meat on purpose to give them the nightmare and make them 
dream all night long of chasing wild boars in the forest.  
Ugh!  I shall never get their terrible yelping out of my head.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Believe me, my dear Madam Barbara, it is the first time the 
brutes ever were known to have been unruly.  I promise that 
they shall be soundly punished and instantly removed.  But 
I too am criminal.  The apartments were selected by me because 
they command the best view of the mountains.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
But I don&#39;t want to look at the mountains.  I got a glimpse 
of it from one of the north windows last night during th e
storm and it looked for all the world like Beelzebub and his 
imps were holding a jubileee there.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Enough, my dear Madam Barbara, enough.  If the mountain is 
unpleasant, it shall be removed.  No, no!  I mean <emph rend="underline"> you</emph> shall 
be removed.
<stage>(Approaching her in a wheedling manner)</stage>
Will it please you to accompany me and choose for yourself?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>

(Simperingly)</stage>
Really, Mynheer Von Puffengruntz, you have such mollifying 
ways that--that--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p><stage>
(Taking her hand)</stage>
Oh-o-o.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Would it be prudent?  Dare I trust myself?  We poor silly 
things are so weak and you mean so naughty that--that--
<stage>(Leans her head upon his shoulder, looks up into his

A strange weird place and one it seems not often tred by human

<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>Aye.</p></sp>

Because just now I heard a bittern cry and twice ere that I

Scene:	The grotto of golden stalactites.  A grand an
comprehensive water cavern of gold, deeply perspective, 
with stalactiform arched roof.  Cut 
wings, representing vistas, running parallel 
and harmonizing with that of the main grotto, 
the mouth of which (5 feet high by 5 feet wide) 
discloses an open lake and distant shore at 
back.  Set transparent silver waters, in which 
are seen sporting fishes and nondescript amphibea; 
diminutive fairies asleep on the waters 
of the grotto in golden shells.  Set ground or 
shore-piece, richly studded with gold and jewels.  
Set masses of emerald and gold R, L, &amp; C., upon 
and at the foot of which are reclining gnomes 
and amphibea.  Fairies asleep in poses R &amp; L.
The Moon, seen through the opening at the back and 
over the distant shore of the lake, shows red 
upon its face at the opening of the scene.  MUSIC.  Shortly 
afterward, DRAGONFIN, who has been asleep 
on a jewelled mass on the shore C, slowly awakens, 
rises and stretches himself.  Upon turning

R &amp; L.  The gnomes , amphibea and fairies rush off R &amp; L

knotted clubs and tridents, the fairies with javelins.

<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>You are right.  Listen all.  Tonight while wandering in the 
fastnesses of the Hartz without my protecting talisman, I 
heedlessly trod within one of the charmed circles of our 
enemy, the arch fiend Zamiel.

<sp>
<speaker>
All</speaker>
<p>Ha!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>On the instant I was transformed into a white dove with 
shorn pinions.  From beneath the rank leaves of an adder-plant
glided a huge serpent.  Its eyes were burning coals,
its tongue a living flame.  I was paralyzed with fear and 
powerless to move.  Nearer and nearer it came.  I felt its 
stifling breath displace the purer air.  I saw its venomed 
fangs glist&#39;ning in the pale moonlight.  Rising from out 
its deadly coil itself, when suddenly a youth, a 
mortal, strangely present in that wildwood spot, seeing the 
danger of the trembling bird seized a dead bough, which 
chance had fashioned like a holy cross, and smote the foul 
thing dead.  Then bore me safely from the charmed spot and 
gave me life and liberty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dragonfin</speaker><p>Revenge, revenge on the minions of Zamiel.

prostrating himself before the Queen, rises and points 
to the water.  Fairies wave their wands.  A small arched

at the distant entrance of the grotto, showing small 
figures of Rodolphe &amp; Greppo in boat, the former at

the water and disappears.  MUSIC.  A small boat with 
two mechanical figures or small doubles of Rodolphe &amp; 
Greppo, as they appeared in the mirror, appears from 
LH outside at the distance entrance of the cavern and 
moves very slowly across.  When it reaches the centre 
of the opening it sinks at the sound of the gong and 
flash of lightning at back.  MUSIC.  HURRY.  All the 
gnomes, amphibea, etc. utter exclaminations of delight 
and indulge in extravagant antics, until checked by a 
gesture from STALACTA.  SOFT MUSIC.  DRAGONFIN rises slowly 
from water C, supporting on either side RODOLPHE 
&amp; GREPPO, the latter gasping violently for breath as 
his head appears.  They step on shore, RODOLPHE &amp; GREPPO
lost in bewilderment.  DRAGONFIN bows low before STALACTA.

Is this a phantasm--this glittering gold, yon flashing gems, 
these strange fantastic shapes?  Have I then passed the portal 
of an unknown world or am I dreaming?

<speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>
Welcome, brave mortal, to our bright domain.  And you my subjects, 
know and greet your Queen&#39;s preserver.</p></sp>

grateful antics, after which the fairies surround 
them and evince their delight)

<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<stage>(Still bewildered)</stage>
If this indeed be not a dream, tell me, bright being--you 
whose simple motion seems to sway the moods and passions of 
this elfin band, who art thou and where am I?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>I am called Stalacta, queen of this dazzling realm.  The glittering 
wonders that assail thine eyes are not creations of 
fantastic dreams but Nature&#39;s handiwork wrought with cunning 
fingers in a bounteous mood.

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
<stage>(Who has picked up a large mass of gold at back comes 
forward)</stage>
&#39;Tis true, master, &#39;tis true.  Behold this shining nugget.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>Who is thy droll companion?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
My simple henchman, a faithful guide and servitor.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>I bid him welcome for his master&#39;s sake.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Thanks, thanks, your resplendent majesty, thanks.

<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
You speak of service done; have we then met before?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>
Yes, once.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Indeed!  When?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>This very night.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Tonight?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>
Tonight, in the glen of fire, but not as now.  Then a poor 
weak, fluttering, charm-encompassed bird, you snatched me 
from the jaws of death, broke the dark spell of transformation 
and gave to me the priceless boon of liberty.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
I do remember--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
And so do I.  Phew, how the sparks flew when master smashed 
the head of the scaly monster.  And such a smell of brimstone.  
I do believe it was one of the Beelzebub&#39;s own imps in disguise.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>Again thou art welcome.  This is my natal hour.  Wilt view the 
sports of this our carnival?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Most willingly.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>And while the revels proceed thou shalt tell me thy story.

(MUSIC.  Seats are brought forward by Amphibea RH1.  
STALACTA &amp; RODOLPHE sit.  GREPPO disposes himself LH1, 
amusing himself with DRAGONFIN, gnomes and amphibea, 
who present him from time to time with nuggets of gold 
and jewels which he thrusts into his pockets until they 
become greatly distended, during which action the diminutive 
sprites re-appear in shells on water floating 
to and from fishing.  The fairies form for dance.  Grand 
ballet action by principals and full corps de ballet, 
during which the fishers in the shells are seen to catch 
some small silver fish)
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
<stage> 
(after the dance terminates)</stage>
Ha, ha, dancing; all very well in its way, but there&#39;s the 
sport for me, fishing!  Look, master, look; see the little 
rougues hook the silly shiners.  Oh, if there&#39;s one thing in 
the world I love more than another its fishing--such fun to 
feel the greedy rascals snap and see them wiggle.  There&#39;s 
another.  Oh I can&#39;t stand it any longer; fishing&#39;s like 
the measles, it&#39;s catching.
<stage>(Turning to amphibea &amp; gnomes)</stage>
Would any of you handsome gentlemen oblige me with a spare 
hook and line?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dragonfin</speaker><p><stage>(Nods assent and brings him rod and line)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Well, upon my word, I&#39;m very much obliged to your scaly 
magnificence.  I&#39;ll do as much for you someday.  By the way, 
is your amphibious majesty fond of fish?</p>
<stage>
(DRAGONFIN nods affirmatively)</stage>
<p>What kind?</p><stage>
(DRAGONFIN indicates that he likes large ones)</stage>
<p>Like large ones, eh?  All right, I&#39;ll make you a present of 
the first ten-pounder I catch.</p><stage>
(MUSIC.  He fishes from the shore RC and catches two 
small fishes, the last quite dimunitive.  The amphibea 
gnomes and fairies laugh boisterously as each fist is 
drawn forth) </stage>
<stage> (GREPPO coming down crestfallen)</stage>
<p>Pshaw, mere sprats and sardines.  Not my kind at all.  This 
is too much like taking advantage of confiding innocence.</p>
<stage>
(To Dragonfin)</stage>
<p>Couldn&#39;t your finny excellency oblige me with a more tempting 
bait, something that would seduce some big, greedy, wiggly-waggly 
fellow into taking a nibble?</p>
<stage>
(DRAGONFIN nods affirmatively.  MUSIC.  DRAGONFIN goes to 
the margin of the water and draws out a large crab which 
he places in the hand of Greppo.  It seizes him by the 
finger to the great delight of the amphibea, gnomes &amp; 
fairies.  He struggles frantically to extricate himself 
&amp; is finally released by Dragonfin who baits the hook 
with the crab and gives him the rod &amp; line)</stage>
<stage>(GREPPO takes 
DRAGONFIN apart confidentially)</stage>
<p>
I don&#39;t know about this.  Excuse me for asking the question,
but, as an unprejudiced observer, don&#39;t you think this 
style of bait more likely to bite the fish than the fish to 
bite the bait?
</p>
<stage>
(DRAGONFIN shakes his head and indicates a large fish 
will take it)</stage>
<p>All right, here goes then.</p>
<stage>
(MUSIC.  He casts the line into the water.  A moment 
after it is violently seized and a frantic struggle 
ensures, during which he is nearly drawn overboard 
two or three times.  Suddenly an amphibeous monster 
spring from the water and pursues Greppo around, 
off and on the stage to the great delight of the 
amphibea, gnomes &amp; fairies who indulge in boisterous 
laughter.  GREPPO in his terror throws himself at the 
feet of STALACTA for protection.  She rises and waves 
her hand.  The monster retires and is pacified by 
DRAGONFIN)</stage><stage>(GREPPO comes forward)</stage>
<p>
Really, my fishy-fleshy friend, you must excuse me.  I beg 
ten thousand pardons.  I hadn&#39;t the remotest idea in the world 
that any of you bottle green gentlemen were lying around loose 
in the bottom watching for a supper of raw crabs.  Indeed I 
hadn&#39;t.
</p>
<stage>
(The monster growls and makes a start at him.  MUSIC.  
DRAGONFIN interposes and pacifies the monster by putting 
him on the back, the taking his hand passes it into 
that of Greppo.)</stage><stage>(GREPPO shakes monster&#39;s hand cordially)</stage>
<p>All right, I accept your apology.</p>
<stage>
(Turning to Dragonfin)</stage>
<p>Now you&#39;re what I call a true friend--a friend in need.  You 
stick by a fellow when he hasn&#39;t the courage to stick by himself.  
This is the second time you&#39;ve done me a service.  Once 
in saving me from too much water and now in saving me from 
too much luck, and I&#39;ll let you see that I can be grateful.
You like fish?</p>
<stage>
(DRAGONFIN nods affirmatively)</stage>
<stage>
(Passing the monster over to him)</stage>
<p>Consider him yours.</p>
<stage>
(All the amphibea, gnomes &amp; fairies laugh and go up)</stage>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p><stage>(Rising &amp; leading Rodolphe forward)</stage>
Thy story claims for thee my pity and my aid.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
And Hertzog, the Black Crook--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>Is a vile sorcerer whose dark unhallowed spells were wrought 
for thy destruction.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
How!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>
Beneath the entrance to this charmed spot lie intertwined 
among the branches of the coraline whole hecatombs of human 
bones, the whitened relics of adventurous mortals who like 
thyself have sought this realm.  Until tonight no human eye 
has ever seen the dazzling splendor of this wondrous dome.  
No human footsteps save thine own and his who follows thee 
have ever pressed these sands of gold. Had not thy coming 
been to me forshadowed and all my power been interposed to 
snatch thee from the impending doom, thou too had&#39;st joined 
the hapless throng that mouldering lies beneath yon depths.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Then is thy debt to me already paid.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>Not so.  I am still thy debtor and must ever be.  Thou art 
environed by danger and need the power of my protection.  Return 
into the outer world again; thy happiness is there.  She 
whom thou lov&#39;st is worthy of thy love; therefore return.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Amina, dear Amina!
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>In the secret cells of this cavern whose walls are solid gold 
lie counteless hoards of richest treasure, gleaned for ages 
by the tireless gnomes.  In the crystal depths of these 
waters sparkle gems richer by far than human eyes have ever 
gazed upon.  Of these thou shalt bear with thee the choicest.
Behold my gift.</p>
<stage>
(MUSIC.  A jewelled stalactiform etagere with strong light 
from calcium on it rises C in front of ground-piece
bearing upon its different shelves rich vases 
filled with gold and various colored jewels which DRAGONFIN, 
gnomes &amp; amphibea remove, performing a series of 
grotesque evolutions to marked Music.  Etagere sinks--
after which MUSIC.  STALACTA waves her hand; a golden 
boat studded with jewels glides on from RH to RC)</stage>
<p>This bark, protected by a potent spell shall bear thee safely 
to yon neighboring shore.  My faithful gnomes shall be the 
treasure bearers.  But ere we part, take thou this jewelled 
circlet.</p>

(Gives him a ring from her finger)
</stage>
<p>Should danger threaten as perchance it will, for baffled 
malice has a thousand stings--press but thy lips upon the gem

shakes hands with the gnomes and amphibea, kisses the 
fairies, bows low to Stalacta and gets into the boat.
A dolphin, glittering in green &amp; gold, rises from behind
2nd or 3rd set waters with principal danseuse 
bearing vase of treasure.  Other dolphins float on 
R &amp; L with diminutive sprites bearing treasure.  Copious 
shower of gold, the other sprites on the water catching 
the flakes in silver shells.  Roses by gnomes, amphibea

Phew, what a relief.  Thank the saints his Countship&#39;s birthday

the death of me.  Ah!  I&#39;m stewed, fried, boiled and roasted.

<speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>
(Aside)</stage>
And still as tough as Dame Gretchen&#39;s gander that was twenty-one
last Easter.<stage>
(Aloud)</stage>
Why, Madame Barbara, I thought you enjoyed it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
So I do, child, so I do, particularly the masquerading.  One 
has so many pleasant things whispered in one&#39;s ear, but I 
can&#39;t say much for the waltzing.  It&#39;s such a terrible 
thing to take the starch out of one&#39;s linen.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>La, Madame Barbara, what&#39;s a little starch?  Nothing.  If I 
waltzed as gracefully as you--
<stage>
(BARBARA makes a gesture of satisfaction)</stage>
--and has such an inviting waist--
<stage>
(BARBARA pinches her waist)</stage>
--I&#39;d keep at it until I was as limp as a boiled cabbage leaf.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Then you--you think me graceful, eh?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Aside)</stage>
As a hippopotamus.
<stage>(Aloud)</stage>
As a sylph.  You were the envy of all the ladies and the admiration 
of all the other sex.  Did you notice the courtly 
gentleman in the blue mask?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
He who danced so often with the lady Amina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Yes, madame.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
And what of <emph rend="underline"> him</emph>?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Nothing, only he was frantic to get an introduction to you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
No was he?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Yes indeed, Madame.  And when his lordship the count engaged 
the lady Amina for a moment, he turned to me, and slipping 
a golden crown into my palm with one hand, pressing his heart 
with the other, asked with a sweet sighing silvery voice, 
trembling with emotion, &quot;Who is that lovely being?&quot;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
No!  Did he?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Yes indeed, Madame.
<stage>
(Aside)</stage>
The saints forgive me for lying.<stage>
(Aloud)</stage>
And Mynheer Von Puffengruntz, who overheard him, turned pea-green 
with jealousy.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p><stage>
(Fanning herself &amp; pressing her hand upon her heart)</stage>
Be still, little trembler, be still.  I declare, my silly 
heart is fluttering like a poor little starling in a gold 
cage.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Aside)</stage>
More like a big buzzard in a steel trap.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Carline, take my fan, child.
<stage>
(Gives it)</stage>
The exertion will make my complexion too ruddy.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>So it will, Madame, and ruddy complexions are not genteel.
Allow <emph rend="underline"> me</emph>.
<stage>(Fans her vigorously)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Not so violent, girl.  You&#39;ll disarrange my hair.  Gently, 
very gently, a sort of sportive zephyr.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>I understand, Madame.  You want a mild sort of tickling sensation--
something like one feels on one&#39;s neck when a gentleman 
whispers in one&#39;s ear.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p><stage>
(Languidly)</stage>
Ye-es.
<stage>(Sighs)</stage>
And he called me a-a-what did he call me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>A swan-like creature. 
<stage>
(Aside)</stage>
A goose.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Oh.<stage>
(Sighs)</stage>
Who can he be, I wonder.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Nobody appears to know exactly, I heard his lordship the 
Count whisper to the Baron von Puffengruntz that he suspected 
the mysterious blue mask to be no other than the young prince 
Leopold.  Once, while dancing, his domino came open at the 
breast and I saw a collar of jewels fit for an Emperor.  However, 
as everybody is to unmask at the grand banuqet, we will 
then know all about him.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Eh, what, the Prince Leopold?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>So his lordship the Count thinks.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Why he&#39;s already affianced as everybody knows, to the young 
Princess Frederica.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Dear me, so he is.  How unfortunate!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Poor young man, how I pity him.  What a terrible thing it is 
to be of royal blood and not have the liberty to choose for 
one&#39;s self.  Heigho!  I know it is a sad, cruel, wicked thing 
to blight a young and budding affection, but as the right 
honorable foster-mother that <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> to be of her right honorable 
ladyship that is to be, I musn&#39;t encourage his highness in 
a hopeless passion.<stage>
(Displays herself)</stage>

Ah-a-a!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p><stage>
(Sighing)</stage>
There&#39;s another victim to love&#39;s cruel dart.  My fan, child.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Giving it)</stage>
Be careful, use it gently Madame; remember your complexion.
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
What a lovely couple--powder and puff.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p><stage>
(Aside)</stage>
What a golden opportunity.<stage>
(Aloud)</stage>
Young woman, as I left the grand hall I heard your mistress 
asking for you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Aside)</stage>
Of course, I understand, cunning old walrus.  May I reture, 
Madame?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Yes, certainly child, that is if her ladyship requires you.
<stage>
(Coquettes with her dress, etc.)
</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Aside)</stage>
I thought so, willing old pelican.  She&#39;s beginning to preen 
her feathers already.  Never mind, I shall have another flirtation 
with the prince&#39;s equerry, the drollest and most agreeable 
fellow in the world, and <emph rend="underline"> such</emph> a rogue.

(VON P FF LH gazes admiringly at Barbara and sighs)
</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p><stage>
(RH casting sidelong glances at him)</stage>
Heigho!  There he is.  My charms tonight have completed the 
conquest.  He&#39;s fast bound in the bonds of rosy cupid.  I see 
a proposal in one eye and a marriage settlement in the other, 
But I mustn&#39;t draw him in too suddenly.  These men are like 
trout, they must be played with a little.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Full moon of the festival, why have you so cruelly robbed 
the grand hall of your light, and left us to grope about in 
the dull glimmer of the sickly stars.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Don&#39;t talk to me about moonship and sickly stars, you heartless, 
gay deceiver.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Deceiver!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Deceiver.  Didn&#39;t I see you gallivanting with the fraulein 
Von Skragneck, the new Burgonmaster&#39;s daughter?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Politeness, my dear Madame Barbara, merely politeness, on my 
honor.  The fact is I-I had the misfortune to tread on the 
lady&#39;s favorite bunion, and what you mistook for tenderness 
was only an apology-an apology, believe me, my dear Madame 
Barbara, only an apology.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Oh, you men, you deceiving men, you are always ready with an 
excuse.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
On the honor of a Von Puffengruntz, I swear I speak the truth.
The fraulein Von Skragneck indeed!  Haven&#39;t I got eyes?  Ah, 
cruel fair one, compared with her and all others, you are 
the stately sunflower in a meadow of dandelions.  As-as-as the 
queen hollyhock in a garden of chickweed.
</p></sp>
<stage>

through trap behind low set plant RH2.  He steps forward 
&amp; listens)
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
It&#39;s coming at last, I know it&#39;s coming.<stage>
(Pressing her heart)</stage>
What a strange flutter.  I hope I&#39;m not going to faint.  Dear 
me, what weak silly creatures we are.  I must nerve myself 
for the trying occasion.  How fortunate it is that I happen 
to have my smelling salts about me.<stage>
(Draws flask from his pocket, turns back to Von Puff 
and drinks)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
She&#39;s moved.  She&#39;s overcome with emotion, she turns to hide 
her blushes.  She yields, and now, like a conqueror, I&#39;ll 
gather in the fruits of victory.
<stage>(He kneels with difficulty at the feet of Barbara, his 
face half-averted, and is about to take her hand when

Poor, frightened thing, how she trembles.

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Dear me, how strangely the tender passion affects him.  He&#39;s 
shaking like an aspen and his hand is as cold as ice.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Bewitching siren, listen to the voice of love.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Oh, Mynheer Von Puffengruntz, how can you--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Don&#39;t call me Von Puffengruntz, call be Maximillian, call me 
<emph rend="underline"> your</emph> Maximillian.
<stage>(Squeezes Dragonfin&#39;s hand; DRAGONFIN squeezes Barbara&#39;s)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Oh, don&#39;t, you naughty man, you--you hurt my hand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
No, did I?  Queen of love and beauty, then let me heal the 
bruise.
<stage>(Kisses the hand of Dragonfin rapturously who, at the 
same time, kisses Barbara&#39;s)</stage>
And now that I&#39;ve healed it let me call it mine.  
<stage>(Looks for the first time attentively at the hand,

<stage>(Aside)</stage>
Shall I keep him a little longer with Cupid&#39;s dart sticking 
in his bosom, or shall I end his misery.
<stage>(Aloud)</stage>
Ahem, you&#39;ll-you&#39;ll never be a haughty boy again?
<stage>
(DRAGONFIN squeezes her hand)</stage>
And you&#39;ll promise never to tread on the froulein von Skragneck&#39;s bunion?
<stage>(DRAGONFIN SQUEEZES her hand)</stage>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
Poor fellow, joy has made him speechless; he can only answer 
with a squeeze of the hand.
<stage>(Aloud)</stage>
Well then, Maximillian, I&#39;m yours.

<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
<stage>(Entering RH1 hurriedly &amp; disturbed)</stage>
Foiled, tricked, crossed in the hour of my victory.  A life 
desperately played for and fairly won snatched from the jaws 
of death.  He lives, my chosen victim lives, and flushed with 
triumph and vast hoards of gold, stalks boldly forth to mock 
mock.  Oh curse the interposing power the stepped between us.  
A withering palsy light upon her arm and blight and pestilence infect 
the air she breathes!  Oh impotent, on, driveling 
fool.  To work, to work.  A soul once tampered with must 
be pursued, not cast aside to tempt another.  So runs the bond 
to which I&#39;ve sealed.  &#39;Tis well, &#39;tis well.  I&#39;ll track him 
as the sleuth hound tracks the stag.  He must be, shall be 
mine.</p></sp>

outre livery)
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>No, no, Master Equerry, that won&#39;t do.  You are very clever, 
very droll and you tell very funny stories, but that last 
joke is a trifle too much.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
But my dear Susetta--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>But my dear Susetta--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Laughing)</stage>
There, there.  I knew you were not in earnest.  My name&#39;s 
not Susetta.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Of course it isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s- it&#39;s- what is it?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>No it isn&#39;t &quot;What-is-it&quot;- -it&#39;s Carline.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Of course it is, but you see I always mean Carline when I 
say Suesetta.  Therefore Susetta--that is my dear Carline, when
I tell you I love you--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>(laughing)
I don&#39;t believe a word you say.  Why you arrived here scarely 
three hours ago, and you&#39;ve already been making love to half 
the girls in the castle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
It&#39;s a mistake, my dear Susetta--I mean Carline, altogether 
a mistake.  I had my eye on you from the first, and any little 
outside pleasantry you may have happened to notice was only 
to get my hand in.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>And this is only to keep it in, I suppose.  No, no.  I&#39;m not 
as simple as I look, and I tell you, clever master Equerry, 
it won&#39;t do.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
But my dear Carline, allow me to tell you that I&#39;m not an 
equerry.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>NO?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
<stage>
(Drawing himself up)</stage>
I&#39;m consulting secretary, confidential adviser, portable 
treasury, and principal disbursing officer to his highness 
the Prince.
<stage>
(Aside)
</stage>
Everybody takes matter for a Prince and it&#39;s no part of my 
business to undeceive them.  Besides if he isn&#39;t a Prince 
he deserves to be and I ought to be his Prime Minister.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Dear me!  Consulting Secretary?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Consulting Secretary!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Confidential Adviser?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Confidential Adviser!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Portable Treasury!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Portable Treasury.  Behold!
<stage>
(Showing two glittering purses)</stage>
Here are two purses, my master&#39;s and my own.  From this--
<stage>(Showing one nearly empty)</stage>
by the Prince&#39;s order came the gold I scattered among the 
servants in the courtyard.  With this 
<stage>
(Showing full one)</stage>
I intend to endow the maiden of my choice.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>And you really mean--</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
That you are she.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>No.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Yes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>I&#39;m afraid to trust you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Allow me to make a deposit.
<stage>(Gives purse)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Opening &amp; admiring purse)</stage>
Oh, dear, you&#39;ve taken my breath away.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
No, have I?  Permit me to return it to you.
<stage>(Kisses her)</stage>
Now listen, my dear little Carline, I have a secret and as 
there should be no secrets between man and wife--that is, 
man and wife that are to be, I&#39;m going to share it with you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>A secret, dear Greppo?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
<emph rend="underline"> Dear</emph> Greppo!  Oh, say that again.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(With increased tenderness)</stage>
Well then, dear Greppo.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Oh, thank you.  You needn&#39;t repeat it again at present.  That&#39;s 
as much as I can stand &#39;till I get used to it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Well, then, the secret.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Yes.  In the first place, do you love your mistress, Carline?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Love her?  I&#39;d die for her.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
No, no, no, no.  I don&#39;t want you to go quite that far.  I&#39;m 
not ambitious to be a widower before I&#39;ve had my honeymoon.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Well, then, I love her dearly.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
That&#39;s better.  And she loves my mas--  that is, young Rodolphe 
the painter?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Better than her own life, poor lady.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
And would marry him but for this ruffianly Count Wolfenstein?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Yes--but the secret.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
<stage> 
(With caution)</stage>
Well, then, you must know--
<stage>
(MUSIC)</stage>
Hark, somebody&#39;s coming.
<stage>(Enter from terrace LH RODOLPHE &amp; AMINA.  He is brilliantly 
dressed, wearing a collar and other ornaments 
of glittering jewels-blue mask &amp; domino.  AMINA also 
wears mask &amp; domino.)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Some one is here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Fear not; they are our own people.
<stage>(Comes forward with Amina)</stage>
Leave us, good Greppo, and take your companion with you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Yes, good master.  Come along, Carline.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Surely I&#39;ve heard that voice before?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
<stage>(Taking her arm)</stage>
Hush.  That&#39;s the secret I was going to share with you, and 
if you&#39;ll take a stroll with me in the ramble that leads to 
the lover&#39;s paradise I&#39;ll tell you all about it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Yes, dear Greppo.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Oh, don&#39;t!</p></sp>
<stage>(MUSIC.  They go off LH1)(RODOLPHE &amp; AMINA unmask)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Oh, dear Rodolphe, is this a dream?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
What&#39;s past seems so, but day has dawned on our long clouded 
night and thgis the awakeing.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Your story is indeed most wondrous.  But on, dear Rodolphe,
I tremble for your life  If you should be discovered the 
vengeance of the ruthless Wolfenstein, backed by his horde 
of fierce retainers would be terrible.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Fear not, I will defend my right with my life.  The same kind 
power that interposed between me and destruction protect us 
still.  You shall be saved.  All is ready for our flight. 
On the border of the forest, beyond the boundary of the gardens, 
swift horses are concealed.  After midnight the moon 
veiling her face behind the bracken, will cast a deep shadow 
over the valley.  When it is quiet I will be beneath your 
window.  The rest is easy.  Carline and my faithful Greppo 
will accompany us.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
<stage>(Throwing her arms around him)</stage>
Oh, my Rodolphe, my more than life, coming this suddenly 
from the darkness of my despair into the sunlight of this 
new-born hope has dazzled me.  My eyelids close.  I cannot 
look this great joy in the face.  I fear to call it mine.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Fear?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Fear with that fear that springs from woman&#39;s love.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<stage>(Kissing her)</stage>
Be calm, sweet love, be brave, and all will yet be well.

<sp><speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis said a serf, a wretch, usurping the semblance of a noble 
prince and bent on outrage has dared to mingle with this 
goodly throng.  If that be false to all I&#39;ll make amends for 
this rude breaking in upon the general joy.  If it be true 
&#39;tis fit we know it.  Therefore I do command that all shall 
here unmask.

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Alas that things ever fall so ill.  &#39;Tis now siz months 
since that never-to-be-forgotten night, and still no news 
of the lost mistress of Wolfenstein.  Nor yet of his lordship 
who has sworn an oath never to return to the castle until 
he has brought her back and revenged himself on the horrible 
monster who has stolen her.  And that graceless baggage Carline, 
too, to go off at the same time, leavimng all the woes 
of the household to fall on my poor shoulders.  And then to 
make matters worse, spells and witchcraft turn all things 
upside down.  The cows milk vinegar, the wells are dry, the 
hens lay addled eggs---
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p><stage>
(Entering RH with very red nose &amp; tipay)</stage>
And all the wine&#39;s turned sour.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Looking ruefully at him)</stage>
There&#39;s another comfort.  To think that I, the right honorable 
foster-mother that <emph rend="underline"> was</emph> to have been to her right honorable 
ladyship that was to have been, for whom many a young and 
tender heart has sighed in vain, should ever have thrown herself 
away upon a wine-butt.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Hic!  A wine-butt, Madam Von Puffengruntz?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Aye, a wine-butt, a beer barrel, a brute that hasn&#39;t drawn a 
sober breath since the day after we were married, now more 
than three months ago.

<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Hic!  A beer-barrel?

<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Hic!  Certainly, of course, just whichever you please, my 
dear, wine-butt or beer-barrel, it&#39;s all the same to me.  
You know you <emph rend="underline"> will</emph> cackle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Cackle!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Hic!  Cackle, my dear.  You know I never have a moment&#39;s peace.  
You&#39;re not even quiet when you&#39;re asleep.  You snore, Madam 
Von Puffengrunz, you snore, loud enough to split the drum 
of my ear and rip up the seam up my nightcap.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Snore, you wretch, <emph rend="underline"> I</emph> snore?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Hic!  Yes, my dear, and have the nightmare.  Hic!  I don&#39;t 
like a wife that snores and I hate a wife that has the nightmare.  
In future I&#39;m going to have separate apartments.  Hereafter 
I intend to sleep alone.

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Alone.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Hic!  I said alone.

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Am I awake?  Who and what do you take me for?

<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Hic!  I took you for a gentle spice-a sort of seasoning 
to the dull life I led here in the castle, but damn it, Madam, 
you&#39;ve turned out to be all the condiments in one, a bottom 
layer of mustard, a top dressing of cayenne pepper and a subeterranean 
lake of vinegar in the middle.

What&#39;s the use?  Now what <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> the use?  The oftener I call,
the fainter comes the answer.  Here it is quite dark, Master 
waiting for the horses and I wandering about like a jack o&#39; lantern,
following the horn of some goblin huntsman.  There&#39;s 
some devil&#39;s work going on.
<stage>(Starting)</stage>

I beg his infernal Majesty&#39;s pardon; I hope I haven&#39;t said 
anything to offend, but strange sights and sounds are in the 
air.  Birds that ought to have gone to roost an hour ago fly 
screaming from tree to tree.  The dismal screech-owl, from 
his hole in the oak answers to the croak of the dreary 
monk-raven and just now I saw a big fat buck scampering through 
the forest with his tail on fire.  Oh, dear, oh daer, what 
fearful omens.  And I&#39;m to be married tomorrow.  If anything 
should happen to me--if my poor dear little Carline should 
happen to be left a widow before she&#39;s made a wife--if I 
should never taste--that is, if I should never know--Oh, 
Lord, it won&#39;t bear thinking of.  I&#39;ll try once more.
<stage>(Winds the horn.  Echo without scarely audible)</stage>
Worse and worse.  Oh Lord, Oh Lord.  I want to go home.

Scene:	Pandemonium.  ZAMIEL in council, seated on an illuminated 
		throne of skulls &amp; flame at back C.  To 
		R &amp; L of C, lesser thrones, that on the right 
		occupied by Redglare, with pen and open book, that 
		on the left by a secretary writing.  At the foot of 
		the central throne two dwarf-demons, pages with 
		wands in attendance.  MUSIC AT RISE.  Fiends discovered
		in a chorus of demoniacal yells and fiendish 
		laughter, dancing around a flashing chasm.  After 
		the action is continued a brief time, ZAMIEL 
		waves his sceptre.  Demons separate and form R &amp; L.

&#39;Tis well.  Let silence reign awhile.  How stands the record 
of the dying year?  Has every seed brought sinful fruit?  Is 
all the harvest gathered in--is every bond fulfilled?

If, when the brazen tongue of clamorous time, now trembling

of hell, let him be summoned.</p></sp>
<stage>(MUSIC.  The demons utter a wild wail of delight and 
resume the dance; the gong strikes twleve.  At the first 
stroke, the demons cease dancing and hold separate 
pictures of exulatation.  At the termination of each 
stroke loud and continued thunder; demons utter a wild 
cry.  Zamiel rises and waves his sceptre.  If possible 
the scene breaks away and discloses vistas of Pandemonium 
teeming with infernal life &amp; wreaths of flame, 
from which appear illuminated heads of demons, skeletons, 
&amp; nondescript monsters.  Gong sounds.  HERTZOG is dragged 
on from RH2 by fiends and is dashed into the flaming 
chasm.  Demons howl and dance around until</stage>
