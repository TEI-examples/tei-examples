									My name is Cynthia, and I am a lady lunatic.

									Does the asylum know you are out?

								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>

									I've lost my reason.

								<p>
									She's a sorceress. To the river with her.

								<p>
									That's no way to treat a perfect lady lunatic.

								<p>
									If you sink we'll believe you.

									But I will not sink. I've been taking swimming lessons

								<p>
									Halt! What would you do with this girl?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>1st Girl</speaker>
								<p>
									She's a sorceress, and her spells produced the recent cyclone.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Witch</speaker>
								<p>
									Then you should thank her on your knees. The storm has made

							<sp>
								<speaker>All</speaker>
								<p>
									Free?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Witch</speaker>
								<p>
									It dropped that house upon your cruel tyrant, the Wicked
									Witch. Her cruel spells and wicked enchantments have caused
									you endless misery. She hated love and happiness, and while
									she lived would not permit you to know them.

								<p>If you are a member of the Sorceress' Union show your card.

							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>I haven't one. I have never sorcered. I am only a sweet
									girl maniac. Listen, and I will tell you my story.
								</p>
								<stage>(Crowd gather around her)</stage>
								<p>I was once a saleslady in one of our largest department
									stores.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>1st Girl</speaker>
								<p>Ah, yes, I have seen your open face at an opening sale of
									umbrellas that wouldn't open.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									No, I was at the alligator counter in the animal department.
									I was engaged to a young musician named Niccolo Chopper who
									played the piccolo.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>1st Girl</speaker>
								<p>
									Poor girl!
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									He was so generous. As soon as our wedding day was fixed he
									gave me my alimony in advance.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>6th Girl</speaker>
								<p>
									Where is he now?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									The Wicked Witch enchanted him. He never returned.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>2nd Girl</speaker>
								<p>
									How do you hope to find him?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									By whistling his favorite tune. No matter what the witch may
									have made of him, if he hears the tune he will answer.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>1st Girl</speaker>
								<p>
									Did he play it often?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<pb />

							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									For hours at a time. You can't imagine how he objected to a
									change of air.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>1st Girl</speaker>
								<p>
									You doubtless learned to love it?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									True. And on moonlight nights he would always play it in the
									vegetable garden back of my semi-Queen Anne suburban boarding
									house.

							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Witch</speaker>
								<p>
									One day, years ago, a balloon brought to the Emerald City
									a mysterious man from a mysterious place they call the
									earth.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>1st Girl</speaker>
								<p>
									I've read about it in our children's books.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Witch</speaker>
								<p>
									The stranger lured Pastoria into the balloon and cut the
									ropes. It bore Pastoria through the clouds. The stranger
									remained and, because of his mystic arts, was crowned King
									of Oz.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<stage>(Exit Witch)</stage>

							<sp>
								<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
								<p>
									If Pastoria gets his throne away from the Wizard of Oz, it
									will be hard luck for me. I'll have to grind out a new
									royal anthem.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<stage>(Cheers off stage R.)</stage>

									Halt! His Majesty would address the army.

							</sp>
							<stage>(Pastoria enters in motorman's coat and hat. He carries

									Men with faces like yours ought to die for somebody. - and
									I'm as good an excuse as you'll ever get.

							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>
									I'm nobody but the King. For years I ruled the Land of Oz
									and was the best dressed little king that ever tied a four in
									hand. The people loved me then, and called me their
									Tony Pastoria.

								<p>
									What's the meaning of that queer costume?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>When the cyclone picked me up I was working as a motorman in
									Kansas.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									What's a motorman?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>Well, a motorman is a fellow that takes life easy. He's a
									regular lady killer, and a sort of business agent for
									the Undertakers' Union. When I reached the earth I had
									to do something for a living.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									Your Majesty had to work? Terrible!
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>
									Yes. Your Majesty had to eat. I grew so desperate I decided
									to stop at nothing, so I became a motorman. It's a merry
									<pb />
									life, and all day long the jingling of the bells. A fellow-
									motorman tried to get me to go with him to Michigan and
									motor there.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									Why?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>He said the girls were more sociable. He used to sing a
									beautiful song about one of them.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									Was it soulful?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>

								<p>Well, you can judge for yourself.

							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>
									Yes. We were blown out of Kansas at the same time. When the
									cyclone struck town I was standing on the front platform
									of my car and had just yelled, "Hold fast for a sharp
									curve". As we sailed over the roofs a beautiful girl
									suddenly shot out of a neighboring cloud and hit my
									dashboard. She was carrying a plate of beans. She said
									she was going my way and before the cyclone dropped us
									through yonder chestnut trees we were engaged.

								<stage>(Entering, L.2. and going to Pastoria)</stage>
								<p>
									Darling, I hope you won't think me gross, but I wish you
									would take me by the hand and lead me to a large porterhouse
									steak.
								</p>
							</sp>

							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>
									Girl, the stake that I am fighting for is not a porterhouse.
									I may be slain. Then what would lovey do if dovey died?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>Why lovey would die too.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<stage>(With arm about her.)</stage>
								<p>
									Do you remember, I met you as a motorman.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>
									I was struck by you at our first meeting.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>
									You were carrying a book.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>
									Roosevelt's Memoirs.
								</p>
							</sp>

							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>
									I ran over them without asking you.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<pb />

							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>
									Because you got the bell to go ahead.
								</p>
							</sp>

							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>
									Then I went ahead to get the belle.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>You couldn't have offered me a palace then.</p>
							</sp>

							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>
									No. About all you could expect from a street car man is
									"a little room up front."
								</p>
							</sp>

							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>
									What were your prospects then?
								</p>
							</sp>

							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>
									Same as the conductors' - only fare.
								</p>
							</sp>

							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>And yet you loved me then.</p>
							</sp>

							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>I yearned for you.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>And you love me now?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>With all the heart a motorman is allowed to have.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>Pasty, you are just too awful!

							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>Is this a lady detective?
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>No. This is a lady lunatic.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
								<p>
									Yes; mad through with blighted love. Now will I to the
									vegetable garden where I last saw him.
								</p>
								<stage>(Taking objects from basket on arm.)</stage>
								<p>Here are young spring onions - they're for insomnia;

								<p>Poor thing -how she loved him! Niccolo must have been

								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>Yes. I reminded her strongly of him.
								</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>But, she is a lunatic. That explains a lot of things.
								</p>
							</sp>

							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>Pastoria</speaker>
								<p>But tell me, what do you think of the country you're to
									reign over as my queen?
								</p>

							<sp>
								<speaker>Tryxie</speaker>
								<p>Oh, well enough as far as I've gone. But it was a bad time

									A pretty Munchkin girl loved me devotedly. Often she came
									and held the trees while I chopped them down, and then
									gently lowered them to the ground. But the wicked witch had
									forbidden any love-making in her domains, and one day Cynthia
									and I were caught holding hands. She enchanted my axe so that
									it slipped and cut off my leg. I went to the tinsmith and had a
									new one made. Then, one by one, I lost my arms, head, and
									body, but the tinsmith replaced each missing member. I kept
									on chopping wood, though, and said nothing. I was happy,
									notwithstanding, until I discovered that I no longer loved
									Cynthia.

								</sp>
								<sp>
									<speaker>Scarecrow</speaker>

										Wouldn't think any more of it than a cold in my head. He

								</sp>

										It's an awful risk, and I'm so fond of the Scarecrow. He
