<head>ACT I</head>
<stage>
<hi rend="underline">SCENE I:</hi> The scene shows the garden of Contrary
Mary near the Widow Piper&apos;s home. A
cask of ale and decorations and
pennats and bunting suggest a fete.
A party of peasants as the scene is revealed.
</stage>
<stage>
No. 1. -- Country Dance and
entrance of the Chorus.
</stage>
<stage>
UNCLE BARNABY enters at the end of the 
dance, smirking and bowing right and
left. The peasants snub him.
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Enjoy yourselves, enjoy yourselves, my dear friends. I am
delighted to see you so happy. Are the Piper children here -
and especially Contrary Mary?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>No, Master Barnaby, Mary didn&apos;t come to the Fete.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>That&apos;s strange, I&apos;m giving it to please her -- and to make you
all a little fonder of me.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Why, are <hi rend="underline">you</hi> our host?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Yes.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<stage>(To the crowd)</stage><p>
Only yesterday he seized poor old Mother Hubbard&apos;s house and
turned her into the road, all for a debt of a few shillings!</p>
<stage>(Crowd jeer at Barnaby)</stage>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl</speaker>
<stage>(To the crowd)</stage><p>
Let&apos;s finish the afternoon by putting Barnaby under the town
pump!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Hurrah!</p>
<stage>(Start to take Barnaby away. TOM TOM ENTERS UP R.)</stage>
</sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Hi! Tom Tom, just in time!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<stage>(Coming down C.)</stage><p>
What for?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(Rushing to Tom)</stage><p>
To save me from the town pump! Stop &apos;em, my boy, stop &apos;em,
don&apos;t let &apos;em hurt your future brother-in-law!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<stage>(At C. laughing)</stage><p>
What you? Which of my sisters had caught your miserly eye?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(Ecstatically)</stage><p>
It&apos;s Mary --willful, but entrancing Mary!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<stage>(Derisively)</stage><p>
YOU want to marry Contrary Mary? You might as well try to turn
off the sun and blow out the stars!</p>
<stage>(All laugh)</stage>
<p>
But let him go, friends, as a favor to me! We may be relatives
yet.</p>
</sp>

<stage>(Goes down L.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(L.C.)</stage><p>
Ah! Then there&apos;s hope for me with Contrary Mary?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Not a gleam, but some day, you <hi rend="underline">may</hi> be my uncle-in-law!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(With pretended grief)</stage><p>
If you mean my niece Jane? She and Alan are at the bottom of the
sea.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>I don&apos;t believe it!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(Mopping eyes with handkerchief)</stage><p>
They&apos;ll never come back to their broken-hearted Uncle Barnaby!</p>
<stage>(TOM TOM goes up stage)</stage>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>And what&apos;s their broken-hearted Uncle Barnaby going to do
with their fortune?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<stage>(CROWD again gathers around Barnaby)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(Hypocritically)</stage><p>
I&apos;m keeping it for them --the law forces me to do tat.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Trust you to take good care of money. You skinflint! But you&apos;ll
be wise if you take better care to keep out of our way hereafter.
Now go!
<stage>(They all jeer and threaten him)</stage>
</p></sp>

<stage>(BARNABY is chased off up R.)</stage>
 <stage>(He exits, followed by Jill &amp; all)</stage>
<stage>(TOM picks up his staff and bundle from steps of house.
HILDA enters from house left.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<p>Master Tom Tom where are you going?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom Tom</speaker>
<p>Hilda, I&apos;m going to find the girl I&apos;m in love with - Jane.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<p>Old Barnaby&apos;s niece? ---<stage>(Gonzorgo and Roderigo enter up right)</stage>
But wasn&apos;t she lost at sea with her brother Alan?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Old Barnaby says so, and that&apos;s why I don&apos;t believe it.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<stage>(Dropping down to him)</stage><p>
But me and my sad faced companion can prove it. We were the
sole survivors of the wreck.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>And who are you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>I was in charge of the ship, my name is Gonzorgo.
<stage>(Pointing to Roderigo.)</stage>
This is my mate and friend to boot.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Yes, friend to boot!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>We swear by our right hands
<stage>(They raise left hands)</stage>
everyone was lost on the ship but us.
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<p>I don&apos;t think they&apos;re telling the truth!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Nor do I!
<stage>(Looking instantly at both of them)</stage>
I remember seeing you two some place before, where was it?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>You don&apos;t by any chance go in for the three B&apos;s do you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Yes, the three B&apos;s. Bridge, Bank Nite and Bingo!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<stage>(Pointing at Gonzorgo)</stage><p>
I saw you at the Village Fair. You were running the carasel.
And you offered to wager you could pick the horse that would come
in first.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<stage>(Drawing sword)</stage><p>
You can&apos;t accuse us of cheating, it must have been two other
scoundrels. Defend yourself!
</p></sp>

<stage>(Attacks TOM, who parries with his staff and knocks
Gon&apos;s sword from his hand as WIDOW PIPER ENTERS from the
house L.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<stage>(Running to her)</stage><p>
Oh, Mrs. Piper, you&apos;re just in time!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<stage>(Coming down C.)</stage><p>
Tom, don&apos;t be rude to the gentleman!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<stage>(Gallantly)</stage><p>
Madam, is he your little boy?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Yes, he is the black sheep of our family -- but I love him!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gon.</speaker>
<p>He can&apos;t be the white-haired boy and still a black sheep.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Maybe she&apos;s color blind.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>
Gon
</speaker>
<p>
Because of that, I spare him.
</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Picks up sword, TOM &amp; HILDA GO UP STAGE)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Accept the blessings of a lonely widow!
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Gon.</speaker>
<stage>(Elbowing Roderigo away)</stage><p>
Have you been lonely long?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Two years.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<stage>(Pointing to Tom.)</stage><p>
And have you only the white-haired black sheep to love?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>No, he has 13 sisters and brothers who need a father&apos;s care.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>That&apos;s a lot of work for one caretaker.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Fourteen children! And -
<stage>(Points to house)</stage>
Is this where you call the Convention to order?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Yes, Mr. Piper left us very well off. And this is our cottage.
<stage>(Gonzorgo and Roderigo look at each other)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to Widow)</stage><p>
I adore the country, don&apos;t you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>I have to.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Why?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Did you ever try to rent an apartment in the City with 14
children?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<stage>(Tenderly)</stage><p>
And when the nestlings have all flown away, have you ever thought
of mating once again?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Well, of course I&apos;ve had my moments. Will you gentlemen enter
and partake of some refreshments?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gon. &amp; Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Will we!? We will.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>I married once for money. If I wed again, it will have to be
an artist, a poet, or a hero.
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>I&apos;m not an expert accountant, but <hi rend="underline">did</hi> you say you had 14
children?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Yes, fourteen.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Your second husband would <hi rend="underline">have</hi> to be a hero.
</p></sp>

<stage>(The THREE EXEUNT into house left)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<stage>(To Tom)</stage><p>
I&apos;ll look for the children, Master Tom, and tell them you&apos;re
going away.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Thank you, Hilda.
<stage>(HILDA exits up Left)</stage>
</p></sp>

<stage>(BO PEEP enters right, dejectedly)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Why, sister Bo Peep, you have the saddest face I&apos;ve ever seen.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bo Peep</speaker>
<p>I missed most of the party, because I lost my sheep.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>That&apos;s nothing for you to feel sheepish about - don&apos;t cry,
little Bo Peep, don&apos;t cry.
</p></sp>
<stage>
<hi rend="underline">SONG #2.</hi><lb/>

(TOM, BO PEEP, PIPER CHILDREN &amp; CHORUS.)</stage>

<stage>(During the song, JILL and OTHER PIPER CHILDREN ENTER)</stage>

<stage>(After number)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ve just found out why old Barnaby is paying for this party.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Why?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>He wants everybody on hand to hear his engagement announcement.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bo Peep</speaker>
<p>Engagement? To whom?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Contrary Mary.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bo Peep</speaker>
<p>Oh, Mary hasn&apos;t gone and done a dreadful thing like that?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Not yet. But mother&apos;s set on the match, and is going to
announce the engagement anyway.
<stage>(ALL express anger)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Let Barnaby keep his old party! I&apos;m going back to tidy up the
stable!
<stage>(Starts up L. to exit. Others stop her.)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bo Peep</speaker>
<p>Party! He can&apos;t buy us with lemonade and chocolate eclaires,
can he girls?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>No!
<stage>(JILL sits on stage down L.C.)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>I hope all of you will keep out of trouble till I get back.
<stage>(Starts up Right)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Where are you going?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Away this very hour to look for Jane!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Miss Moffett</speaker>
<p><stage>(One of the Piper children)</stage>
Do keep out of that awful forest! They say there&apos;s a veil in
it filled with spiders.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>I will, Little Miss Moffett, no spiders for you eh? I know how
tough it was on the tuffet.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Miss Moffett</speaker>
<p><stage>(Shuddering)</stage>
I don&apos;t like to see spiders. When you&apos;ve seen one of them
you&apos;ve seen them all.
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Well I&apos;m off on my hunt for Jane. Who&apos;ll go as far as the turn
of the road with me?
<stage>(Starts up right)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>All of us!
</p></sp>

<stage>(HILDA ENTERS from house left, with small package in hand)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<p>Wait, Master Tom, you mustn&apos;t go around the world hungry.
Here&apos;s a box of sandwiches with jelly and pickle.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Thank you, Hilda. And good-bye! Come along, boys and girls.
<stage>(EXITS with ALL except HILDA and Jill)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<stage>(Waving to Tom)</stage><p>
Goodbye! Goodbye! Just think, he&apos;s leaving his native home
land. He&apos;ll be like a man without a country. What can be
worse than that!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Nothing "except a country without a man".
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<p>He&apos;s going around the world to find his sweetheart.
<stage>(JANE ENTERS up L. in gypsy boy&apos;s costume)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>And everybody knows that Jane is under the ocean.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>Everybody except Jane!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<p>You? It isn&apos;t you, is it?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>Hilda, it simply can&apos;t be anybody else!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<stage>(Embracing her)</stage><p>
Where&apos;s Alan?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>He stopped to pin up a tear in his skirt.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Skirt?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>After the shipwreck, our clothes were in tatters-- but we met a
band of gypsies that gave us what clothing they could spare.
And we had to arrange it thus.
<stage>(Indicates costume)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<stage>(Pointing off L.)</stage><p>
And here&apos;s Alan, a regular gypsy!
</p></sp>

<stage>(ALAN ENTERS dressed as a gypsy girl with tambourine
swinging from waist.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Hilda and Jill! Would you know me?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<p>Never, Alan, if I hadn&apos;t been told.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I am Floretta - until further notice--Floretta, the Fawn of the 
Forest.
<stage>(Pirouettes)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<stage>(To Hilda)</stage><p>
How is our Uncle Barnaby?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<stage>(At C)</stage><p>
Your Uncle Barnaby is well.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Eagerly)</stage><p>
And Contrary Mary?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<stage>(With meaning)</stage><p>
Still waiting for a certain young man to come back from being
drowned.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>Where&apos;s Tom Tom?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hilda</speaker>
<stage>(Goes up R)</stage><p>
Just started to find you. Quick! If he hasn&apos;t gone too far, we
can catch him!
<stage>(Points off R)</stage>
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>Don&apos;t go away, Alan, and look out for the Widow Piper.
Remember you&apos;re not too popular, with Mary&apos;s mother.
Hilda and Jill, let&apos;s hurry!
<stage>(HILDA, JILL &amp; JANE EXEUNT quickly up right)</stage>
</p></sp>

<stage>(THE WIDOW PIPER ENTERS FROM house)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Ah. here you are now!...I mean, do you want your palm read?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>A gypsy! Yes I will have my fortune told. Can you tell fortunes?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Better than an income tax collector. I peek into the future
at 25 cents a peek.
<stage>(WIDOW gives Alan money)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>There, peek for me!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Looks at her hand)</stage><p>
Your name is Piper! You&apos;ve had an unfortunate marriage.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Can you tell that by the lines in my hand?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>No, by the lines under your eyes. Your husband is dead. He was
not very handsome, he had A. &amp; P. eyes. One eye faced the
Atlantic and one eye faced the Pacific. You have a daughter
named Mary. She should marry a young man whose name begins with
A. He has a lovely character, is charming, gifted and attractive.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>If you&apos;re talking about a wretched, no-account young fool named
Alan, you&apos;re <hi rend="underline">all</hi> wrong.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>No, I am -- that is he is -a character every one could love.
I&apos;d even love him myself,-- that is, if I knew him.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>I don&apos;t think this is such a very good reading.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I could do better with tea leaves....if you could bring me a
cup of tea....and perhaps some hot biscuits...I also read the
future by hot buttered biscuits.
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Go ahead, Gypsy, and tell me more about myself.
<stage>(Gonzorgo enters from house.)</stage>
I have two suitors - which shall I marry?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I must see them first.
<stage>(Widow points to Gonzorgo)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>There is one!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Well, if that is one, I&apos;d advise you to take the other.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>What have we here, a gypsy?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Yes. Let her read your hand.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<stage>(To Alan)</stage><p>
I give you my hand, to find out if she-
<stage>(Indicating widow)</stage>
Will give me her hand.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>But first you must take off your glove.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gon.</speaker>
<p>I&apos;m not wearing gloves, my hands are sunburned.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Examining his hand)</stage><p>
Yes, expecially the palms.
<stage>(Looks in hand)</stage>
Oh, I can&apos;t go on! After you&apos;ve had your hands read will
your face be red!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>I know you see there a mad love and devotion.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Yes, I can see you returning home at night and this lady
with her fourteen children, waiting to greet you on the
front porch.
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Yes...
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Yes, and your present wife and triplets waiting for you on
the back porch!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Gonzorgo! You! You are married?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Well, yes, and no!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Make up your mind!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl</speaker>
<p>Do you tell fortunes?

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Do I? It was destined by the stars that I was to be a fortune-
teller. My father was born under the sign of the crab,

<p>I don&apos;t understand you.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<stage>(To him)</stage><p>
You can hear us, even if we are your silent partners.
And here&apos;s what we want to broadcast to you. How about our
contract to get rid of your niece and nephew?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>What have you done with Jane and Alan?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>They are now playing harps with Saint Pete and his golden Gaters.
<stage>(Roderigo sobs)</stage>
We chartered an old dilapidated schooner and we lured Alan
and Jane on board, we told them it was the show boat.
<stage>(Roderigo sobs)</stage>
The boat was an old dilapidated wreck that we christened
"Static". We knew the schooner would soon be under the foam.
<stage>(Roderigo sobs)</stage>
The weather bureau said it would be clear weather but we knew
they were wrong as usual. Soon it began to rain - it rained
cats and dogs, - I know because I stepped in several poodles.
<stage>(Roderigo sobs)</stage>
We knew if the storm struck -- the waves would strike -- and the
crew would go on a sit-down strike. Well, <hi rend="underline">IT</hi> did - - <hi rend="underline">they</hi> did --
and <hi rend="underline">we</hi> did. Down went the hull of the Ship.
<stage>(Roderigo sobs)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>You mean the <hi rend="underline">whole</hi> of the ship.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Hull or whole- what is a little pronunciation among friends?
The ship sank! And everyone but us two are now sleeping on
the ocean bed with oysters as pillows.</p>
<stage>(Barnaby suddenly begins to sob)</stage>
<p>
What are you crying for?
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ve seen the last of my little charges.

<p>And now you&apos;ll see the first of ours.

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>

<stage>(Hands bill to Barnaby)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(Reading it)</stage><p>
500 dollars!?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>For scuttling one ship.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>What part of it did you do?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>I was 1st vice-president in charge of the scuttle department.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Follow me down to my office, I am the manager of the T.C.N.P.U.
--Finance Company. There is much money in my vault.

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>My future husband? Who is he?

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>There&apos;s my reason.

</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ve got to believe my eyes.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>You believe your eyes before you believe me? Then I&apos;ve found
you out in time. You never loved me--and--don&apos;t you dare to ever
speak to me again!

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>How?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ve told them I bought a new country house while they were

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>It wasn&apos;t us. I wouldn&apos;t harm a hair in anyone&apos;s head -- not

A well-bred detective never runs a lady down.

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>Strangers! Where did you come from?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>We know where we come from, but we don&apos;t where we&apos;ve
got to. We were lost in a forest at our home, and after many
adventures, reached a strange sea coast. A passing vessel
brought us here, and we don&apos;t care how soon another takes us
away.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>This is Toyland.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(To Marmaduke)</stage><p>
Toyland? Were you made in Germany or Connecticut?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p><stage>(Indignantly)</stage>
I&apos;m not a dummy. I&apos;m a detective.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>What&apos;s the difference?

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>You&apos;ll be sure to find her now.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>Why?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>A polka-dot dress is always spotted.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>Bah!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>If I could only find Tom Tom, I wouldn&apos;t care.
</p>

<stage>(To Marmaduke)</stage>
<p>
Do you know Tom Tom?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>Is it anything like Contract?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>No, he&apos;s a young man - very very handsome...and he has the
grandest eyes and teeth and the most sensitive ears --
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>I&apos;m not in the least interested.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>Of course everybody doesn&apos;t call him Tom Tom.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>No, especially those who don&apos;t know him.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>His family name was Piper, so to strangers he is Mr. Piper,
but he is very very handsome, and he has the grandest eyes
and teeth, and the most sensitive ears.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>But I haven&apos;t sensitive ears.

<p>I could be Uncle Don Crosby. That&apos;s something new, isn&apos;t
it? Giving advice to the children in song form.

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>There&apos;s nothing to pay. I am the world&apos;s master toymaker

rememberance in the heart of a child is more to me than
anything else in the world.

<sp><speaker>Bo Peep</speaker>
<p>Haven&apos;t you any little boys and girls of your own?

ear.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>My name is Jill. What&apos;s yours?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>Grumio. I&apos;m the Master Toymaker&apos;s apprentice. What do you
do?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Oh, I live a life of leisure, but I&apos;m going to leave
society and go to work. Perhaps I&apos;ll even be on relief.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>I had trouble at home too. Mother kept a butler,
who objected to my wearing his evening clothes.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>But didn&apos;t you ever have any other ambitions?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>Yes, I wanted to be a politician. It&apos;s the only business
where you can sit down and run at the same time!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Is there any chance of landing a job here.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>Come to my master&apos;s workshop. They&apos;re shorthanded there
and I can get you a place.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Can you fix my doll there?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p><stage>(Holding doll so sawdust pours out)</stage>
Yes, better hurry up, she may have a sawdust hemmorhage.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>What&apos;ll you charge?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>My charge will be just one kiss.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>All right, you send the bill to mother.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>But after I&apos;ve seen mother&apos;s face, I may not want to collect
it. Give me one kiss and I&apos;ll be satisfied.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>No.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>You won&apos;t give me one kiss.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Yes, but you won&apos;t be satisified.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>I just wanted to find out what a kiss was.

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>A kiss is nothing divided by two.

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
 <stage>(Contd)</stage><p>You got that kissing idea from the movies...from now on

You may report to me in the toyshop, in an hour!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(ENTERS from arch.)</stage><p> <stage>(To Toymaker)</stage>
You&apos;re the King-pin of all the toymakers, I&apos;ve heard. I&apos;d
like to hire you to make a few toys for me.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>Ah, then you love the children too?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Oh, I simply dote on them!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>What would you like me to make for them?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>A lot of dangerous toys. Toys that a child would eagerly
accept. That would destroy them, and even kill them,
in some clever way.
<stage>(JANE ENTERS under arch, overhears)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>Why do you hate the children so bitterly?

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>My late sister left her two vicious bad-tempered children
Alan and Jane for me to look after. What a life they&apos;ve 
led me! Even their fortune, which will be mine in another
week, could hardly repay me for the trouble they have caused
me.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>Are they dead?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Yes, they were lost in the forest, I&apos;ve seen the last of them!
</p>

<stage>(JANE exits silently)</stage>
<p>A thousand dollars, if you&apos;ll take the order. Twelve hundred!
Fifteen hundred!</p>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>No, no!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Eighteen hundred!
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>No, no, don&apos;t tempt me. Eighteen hundred dollars for toys,
that would kill and destroy!
</p></sp>

<stage>(Starts off L.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ll make it two thousand dollars! Just let me see you
alone in your work shop, and we&apos;ll close the bargain.
<stage>(BOTH EXEUNT L)</stage>
</p></sp>

<stage>(JANE and ALAN enter under arch much excited)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>And if we&apos;re not home in a week, Uncle Barnaby gets our
fortune!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>Yes, that&apos;s what I heard him say!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Now I understand Uncle Barnaby now I know him.
He&apos;s as easy to see thru as a cellophane wrapper.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>I&apos;m sure he had us lost in the woods.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>And lost at sea the same way. Oh, he&apos;s been playing a losing
game with every way.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>We must get home--we haven&apos;t a penny, what&apos;s to be done?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Or, who&apos;s to be done?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>First let us change these clothes. Nobody else in Toyland
dresses like this, and Uncle Barnaby will surely hear
about us.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>That&apos;s a risk we can&apos;t afford. We must shift our wardrobe,
but how?
</p></sp>

<stage>(JILL ENTERS L)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>

</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I hope you&apos;ve run away with a tailor!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>Or a dressmaker.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Neither, but I&apos;ve just been engaged to dress the dolls at
the Master Toymaker&apos;s.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Do you think you could find anything there to fit us?
We don&apos;t want to be captured.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Perhaps, some of the Toymaker&apos;s dolls are nearly as big as
you.

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>

</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<stage>(Looking over her shoulder)</stage><p>
But you&apos;re not the one I was speaking of.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>Listen to me for a moment! Do any of you know a girl named
Mary? Don&apos;t answer if it may incriminate you.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Who are you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>I am the world&apos;s most famous inspector!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>What of boilers?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>No, of the police! Describe Contrary Mary to me.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>She has long bobbed hair, a lovely speaking voice,
but very loud. And she cries so much her cheeks are streamlined.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p><stage>(Taking notes)</stage>
Complexion?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Fair. Just fair, and I believe at that I&apos;m exaggerating.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>How was she dressed when you saw her last?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>She was wearing a white fish net over black satin....
the satin was white at one time. The neck line was high
with a Freddie Bartholomew collar...The back was low,
sweet and lo, - there were little cream puff sleeves...
with blue ribbon on the side...
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>I don&apos;t believe --
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>The dress was straight to the knees, where it was gored by
8 champagne inserts to give it a waltz swing...a sort of
Champagne Waltz!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marmaduke</speaker>
<p>I don&apos;t believe I&apos;m getting anywhere....but I <hi rend="underline">am</hi> getting
<hi rend="underline">any</hi>where--anywhere away from you!
<stage>(Dashes off under arch)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bo Peep</speaker>
<p>Well, you certainly tired him out!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>You don&apos;t know how glad I am to see you all, but I wish
Tom Tom were here....
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Boy Blue</speaker>
<p>And what about Alan? Don&apos;t you miss him?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>

<stage>(JILL enters L.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>What&apos;s the matter, Grumio?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p><stage>(Pointing to head)</stage>
I&apos;ll be put in jail for this. This was the wooden soldier
that was to head the wooden regiment he presents to the
City today... I had charge on him, and when I went to wind
him up, I found someone had stolen his clothes. Let me
find out who did it! That&apos;s all!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<stage>(Melodramatically)</stage><p>

<stage>(Falls on knees)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>You?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Strike and avenge yourself! I took the clothes to help
two old friends...
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>Ah! To help old friends you ruin me! Be gone, female, and
leave me to the sorrow you have brought upon me!
<stage>(Throws her to the ground and steps over her)</stage>
</p></sp>

<stage>(JANE &amp; ALAN enter in the doll costumes and exchange

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Noting Grumio&apos;s red hair)</stage><p> <stage>(Aside to Jane)</stage>
Looks like a bottle of Chili sauce.
<stage>(Aloud)</stage>
Who are you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>The Toymaker&apos;s apprentice, who is responsible for the toys
that you have broken.
<stage>(Points to wooden captain&apos;s broken head)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>The wooden captain?
<stage>(To Jill)</stage>
The toy I broke when I took these clothes off of him!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>The same. It&apos;s time for the parade, but I can&apos;t start
without the wooden captain.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Well, <hi rend="underline">I</hi> can&apos;t do without his clothes.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p><stage>(With sudden inspiration)</stage>
Then by the way of paying for them, you might lead the
parade yourself.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Surprised)</stage><p>
What - me?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>That will get me out of the trouble that you have got me
into. Do you think you could act like a toy soldier?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<stage>(To Alan)</stage><p>
Of course -- just be yourself.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Jane, I&apos;ll lead the parade, and you can look for Tom Tom.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>I&apos;m sure Tom Tom isn&apos;t here.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(To Grumio)</stage><p>
One word more, my one cylinder brained friend! If I get you
out of this trouble, will you help us to get out of the country?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>Come to the work shop after the parade, and I&apos;ll arrange it!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
Jane and Alan
</speaker>
<p>

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>It&apos;s a cold world, Gonzorgo; unless something turns up,
I shall worry myself into a stew.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Worry yourself into two stews if possible- one for me!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Is it true what the gypsy said, are you married now?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>No, my wife passed away a year ago. The <hi rend="underline">light</hi> of my life has
gone, but I&apos;d like to strike another match!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>And here comes a possible flame! It&apos;s the Widow Piper.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>My woodland fllower!--
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Why do you call her a woodland flower?

<p>She&apos;ll grow wild, if someone doesn&apos;t cultivate her!

Have you forgotten what Floretta, the Fawn of the Forest

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>&apos;Tis false, you are the only girl I ever loved. Don&apos;t seek
further for a husband!

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Find my daughter Mary for me and I shall consider it!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>What is she like?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>She&apos;s only 15, very pretty, and very brainy. Here&apos;s a
description of her written on this paper. Find her and you
may be lucky!
<stage>(EXITS)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<stage>(To Roderigo)</stage><p>
If you were a young girl very pretty and very brainy, what
would you do?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>I&apos;d enter a beauty contest.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>No, I said <hi rend="underline">brainy</hi>. Brains! But if she is going to marry
old Barnaby, you could use her for a blue print to make an
idiot!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Yes, old Barnaby is 45, and she&apos;s only 15. He&apos;s three times
as old.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Yes and in five years he&apos;ll be fifty and she&apos;ll be 20, then
he&apos;ll only be two and a half times as old.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Yes and in 15 years he&apos;ll be sixty and she&apos;ll be thirty
then he&apos;ll only be twice as old!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>How long will she have to wait before they become the
same age?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<stage>(Reading from the paper)</stage><p>
The paper says she left with someone else. It reads, "The
missing twain". Say, what does twain mean?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Twain, it means two!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>What?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Two -two! Twain!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>You&apos;re too old to be talking baby talk!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>My dear Watson, this is a very baffling case.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Don&apos;t you know a good solution?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Yes, boracic acid, that&apos;s a good solution. Now the
girl has been stolen by some desperate criminial, now
let&apos;s both concentrate. Who is the worst criminal you
know?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>My mistake, I&apos;ve had a couple of drinks.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>Two drinks, and I&apos;m girls! If you had 5 drinks I&apos;d be quintuplets!
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>You don&apos;t like me, do you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>In spite of your faults, I think you&apos;re the tops!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>I must be the top, my head is still spinning.
But come, my Princess, it is gay tonight in Vienna - there
is music, wine and waltzing. Will you waltz with me?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jill</speaker>
<p>No - but if you&apos;ll come out of Vienna - I might dance with
you.
</p></sp>

<stage>(DANCING SPECIALTY, or THEY Waltz to an exit)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>What&apos;s this? Men, clear away the ruin. The scamp has been
at the wine!

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Here I am according to appointment.
<stage>(Coming down)</stage>
Have you thought over my offer?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>For toys that will maim and injure children?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Something tells me you would put your whole heart into the
work.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p><stage>(Sneeringly)</stage>
Your <hi rend="underline">liberality</hi> would call for that much interest.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Your final answer?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p><stage>(Taking him Center)</stage>
What would you say to a doll with the spirit of a fiend
controlling it? Would it not be a dainty gift for a child
one dislikes?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>A doll with the soul of a demon, a master thought!
</p></sp>

<stage>(He grasps Toymaker&apos;s hand)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>Come back in the twilight, in the interval I&apos;ll experiment again.

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>Aha! You scoundrel, you drank my wine, didn&apos;t you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>No, sir, I was just testing it for you! The captain of
the ship wants to see you on board at once!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p><stage>(Impatiently)</stage>
What about?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>It&apos;s something about the cargo you&apos;re sending.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>Very well! And when I return call my attention to the fact
that you are to be discharged.
<stage>(EXITS.)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir.
<stage>(Going quickly to door R.)</stage>
Bring the wrappings, Jill! You men bring these crates!
.....Alan and Jane will travel in style!... <stage>(Men bring in 2
packing boxes, exeunt)</stage> <stage>(ALAN &amp; JANE ENTER L.C.)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>How about us? How are you going to get us out of the country,
your ship sails in an hour.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>You go as freight.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>You mean as dolls?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>You&apos;ll be taken on board the ship, that&apos;s bound for your
country in those.
<stage>(Indicting crates)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Be sure we&apos;re marked fragile, this side up!
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>And I hope I&apos;m sent F.O.B. Free of bumps!

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Jane, take care of yourself!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<stage>(Steps into open crate)</stage><p>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p>So far, so good!
</p></sp>

<stage>(MARY enters just before Grumio can get down into crate)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Grumio, I want you to run out and match this sample.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p>
It&apos;s Mary!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<stage>(Giving Grumio bit of ribbon)</stage><p>
Quickly, please, four yards. Bring it back at once.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Grumio</speaker>
<p><stage>(Going reluctantly)</stage>
That doll&apos;s all right.
<stage>(Points to Alan)</stage>
You needn&apos;t bother about him, Mam&apos;selle.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Hurry! Hurry!
<stage>(Grumio exits L.C.)</stage>
<stage>(Mary looks at Alan, starts violently)</stage>
Only a wooden dummy with no sense and yet he reminds me so
much of Alan!
<stage>(Turns right)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p>
In this game I am the dummy!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<stage>(Looking at Alan)</stage><p>
Poor boy, it&apos;s very like him. I could almost imagine we were
alone together. If he&apos;s meant for an officer, he needs
something to show his rank.
<stage>(Goes to work table and gets properties)</stage>
</p><p>
Shall I sew them on? No, it would be quicker and safer to
nail them on his chest.</p>

<stage>(Looks on table for tacks and hammer)</stage>

<pb/>
<p>
I might nail on a few yards of fresh gold braid while it&apos;s
on my mind.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p>
Your mind, oh, don&apos;t mind me!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>This will do, and this-
<stage>(Tries medals on Alan&apos;s coat)</stage>
Dear, dear, but you <hi rend="underline">are</hi> like Alan!
<stage>(Angrily)</stage>
I wish you were, that&apos;s all! To believe that I&apos;d forget you
for such a creature as Barnaby! Will I ever see you again?
Oh Alan where are you now, I wonder!
<stage>(Turns away)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p>
So, you&apos;re wondering too!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Will you ever come back and say "Mary I&apos;m dreadfully sorry
I was all wrong?" And you know what I would do, I would embrace
you, Alan!
<stage>(Embracesm him)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Slowly embraces her)</stage><p>
<stage>(She is surprised and startled)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Why, what is the matter with this machine? It must be out

</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Mary!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>It is you, Alan, after all!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>And now you say something like I&apos;ll forgive you Alan.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>I do, I do!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>And I&apos;ll say Mary I was dreadfully sorry, I was all wrong.
Because you knew all the time...
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Yes, I knew all the time that you loved me.

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>It means that Grumio is going to ship us home as dolls on a

</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>In that case, where is Jane?

<p><stage>(ENTERS L.C. Alan resumes a toy attitude)</stage>

</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>Something wrong with his machinery.
<stage>(ALAN moves his hand automatically)</stage>
I&apos;ll attend to that before he goes to Siberia.

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>

<stage>(MAN enters with marking pot and brush, used for

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p><stage>(To working man)</stage>
Cross out the address on those crates, and write these.
<stage>(Handing workman also a slip of paper)</stage>
Send that to his Majesty, the Sultan of Beejumbo!
It&apos;s going to be a surprise for the Sultan&apos;s harem!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p>
Ah, a harem!
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, sir, but aren&apos;t you getting them mixed?
<stage>(Points to Alan)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p>
Oh no, he isn&apos;t getting them mixed.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>So I am. It&apos;s the Dutch Doll that goes to the Sultan.
<stage>(Points to Jane&apos;s crate, and workman paints new
address on it)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<stage>(Touching Alan)</stage><p>
This one is broken.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>There&apos;s time to fix him. He goes by caravan tomorrow. He&apos;s
bound for Kalamazooskie, Eastern Siberia.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p>
Kalamazooskie sounds like a long way from home.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>His uniform needs something.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p>
If I&apos;m going to Siberia, I need an overcoat.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>But he can&apos;t be fixed inside of a week, and the Dutch Doll
isn&apos;t all right, either.
<stage>(Points to Jane&apos;s crate)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>What&apos;s the matter with her?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>She needs a new face.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p>
I&apos;m glad Jane can&apos;t hear that.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>You can&apos;t send those wax faces to hot countries.
They melt. She ought to have a wooden head like this.
<stage>(Raps Alan&apos;s head)</stage>

</p>

<stage>(CRASH OFF STAGE L.C.)</stage>
<p>
What&apos;s that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>That&apos;s Jane always crashing in some place where she&apos;s not wanted.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>We must help her. I&apos;ll run and see what I can do!

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Undo your work, before it is too late!

<sp><speaker>Toymaker</speaker>
<p>There is gratitude, I give you human form, I take you from the

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Take care, these things have only murder in their hearts.

Obey, or else I&apos;ll send your souls back to the abyss

<p>Where?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>To a far away country that Jane and I visited after our
shipwreck.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Is the country you&apos;re talking about a nice one for -- for young
married people?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>When young people marry they go to a place that&apos;s usually
called Maple Heights. Because it&apos;s surrounded by willow trees.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Willow trees? We could plant a bed of onions right next
to them and have weeping willows.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>It&apos;s called the heights because it&apos;s on a prairie.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>I know the place, the renting agents says it&apos;s five minutes
from the station... that is if you travel by aeroplace.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Then a kind business man builds them a semi-colonial cottage
on weekly payments. And after you&apos;ve been married forty years
then the Bond and Mortgage company takes it over.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>And I suppose they fall in love just as we do, and they
exchange all sorts of beautiful vows.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Before marriage?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>And after?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>It&apos;s quite the same as here and everywhere else.

<stage>(Dialogue after 1st verse)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>So you&apos;re keeping a budget? All I brought in the last year
was one necktie. You have ordered 14 dresses, four pairs
of shoes, one squirrel coat, without consulting ne.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Well, I have to wear them don&apos;t I?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Yes but I have to pay for them, don&apos;t I?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>No, you don&apos;t. I haven&apos;t asked you for a single cent for a
whole year. I have had everything <hi rend="underline">charged</hi>.
</p></sp>

<stage>(Dialogue after 2nd verse)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>How many times have I asked you not to read the newspaper at

</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>What else is there around here interesting?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>You never dared speak to me like that before we were married.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Well, before we were married you never came down to breakfast
looking the way you do!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Mother always said you were a brute. Oh, why did I ever marry
you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>So you&apos;re beginning to wonder too?

<sp><speaker>Girl</speaker><p>So your wife is always quarrelling with you?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Yes, every time I go out, she accuses me playing cards with

</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Girl</speaker><p>
It was nice of you to take your secretary out, have a few
cocktails and then go dancing...but how will you explain it to
your wife?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>There&apos;s only one way out of it - and that is to tell her the
truth! Goodnight!
</p></sp>

<stage>(LIGHTS OUT. Then Alan discovered at left with his wife)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>And where have <hi rend="underline">you</hi> been?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>My dear I&apos;m going to tell you the truth. I wanted a little
relaxation, so I took my secretary out and we had some cocktails,
and then we went to a night club.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Don&apos;t you try to fool me. You&apos;ve been playing cards again!
</p></sp>

<stage>(Slaps his face)</stage> <stage>(ALAN &amp; MARY EXEUNT after song)</stage>

<stage>(BARNABY ENTERS.)</stage> <stage>(He reads from paper)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>So Alan objects to being tried by a court of nine judges?
And he petitions to ask for an appointment of fifteen. He
doesn&apos;t realize it&apos;s unconstitutional.
</p></sp>

<stage>(MARY ENTERS)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<stage>(Seeing Barnaby)</stage><p>
Oh, it&apos;s you, is it?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(Sneeringly)</stage><p>
It&apos;s a fine morning for a wedding, Mistress Mary.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Whose wedding?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Ours. I&apos;ll be short and sweet with you, Mistress Mary!
There&apos;s a marriage bureau next to the court-room--
<stage>(Points off)</stage>
and we&apos;ll be married there at once, or...
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Or what?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ll hand Alan over!
<stage>(Pointing L.)</stage>
He&apos;s in there. I know his disguise. In a moment the Court
Royal will condemn him for killing the Toymaker.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>You wouldn&apos;t betray him?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(Snivelling)</stage><p>
It&apos;s my duty! He has disgraced the family. He&apos;s an assassin!
But for your sweet sake I&apos;ll let him escape.
</p>

<pb/>

<stage>(Mary tries to break away)</stage>
<p>
No, you won&apos;t warn him.
</p>
<stage>(GONZORGO and RODERIGO dressed as executioners, with
brazier, ropes, pincers, enter from court-room with
large legal document)</stage>
<p>
What you have there?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>A warrant to execute Alan, your scamp of a nephew!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(To Mary)</stage><p>
You shall decide. Will you take his life, or my name?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Let me see that warrant!
<stage>(Reading)</stage>
Rack--hot irons--pincers for my Alan!</p>
<stage>(Throws warrant aside)</stage>
<p>
Is it is to save Alan, I&apos;ll agree. Take me to the marriage
bureau!
</p></sp>
<stage>(Seizes Barnaby and rushes him off stage)</stage>

<stage>(ENTER JANE R. PIPER AND CHILDREN ON R. &amp; L.)</stage>
<sp><speaker>
Miss Jane</speaker>
<stage>(Seeing Gon. and Rod)</stage>
<p>Why, when did you two start out as plumbers?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gon.</speaker>
<p>We&apos;re not plumbers, we&apos;re executioners. We know nothing about
the business, it was influence and this is a political appointment.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>You look like you belong to the Black legion!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rod</speaker>
<p>We&apos;re amateurs at this rope business, but we&apos;ll soon get the 
hang of it!
</p></sp>

<stage>(Exit Roderigo)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>Has the court sent for you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gon.</speaker>
<p>It has. We shall shortly fill our first order.

</stage>
<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>It will be Alan. But you will be cursed if you do anything
to hurt him.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Cursed? Lady, we&apos;ve been cursed by hard luck all our lives.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>You don&apos;t know what hard luck is. I think one of my

<p>Oh, ever since I was a kid no matter what I said or did,
You&apos;d always find me in an awful boat,
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>And every photograph of me off in the background you would see
Somebody always leading off my goat.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>I&apos;m great big mister easy mark, and life for me has been no lark
I&apos;m quite unhappy, sad as I can be.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>Good luck for me has been real slow, and I have had my share of woe,
Just like an undertaker&apos;s jubilee.

Chorus:

<l>Meet me under the <hi rend="underline">hard luck</hi> moon,</l>

<l>Hoodoo songs off key.</l>
<l>Where skies are blue,</l>

<l>In such a mournful tune,</l>
<l>We&apos;ll have a grand old kill-joy time,</l>

<sp><speaker>Jane</speaker>
<p>It will be Alan. Boys and girls, this coward will kill Alan.
Don&apos;t let him.
<stage>(Pipers threaten Gonzorgo)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Simon</speaker>
<p>We won&apos;t. We will never let you live to do this.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Young man, don&apos;t you dare lay hands on an officer of the law!

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Now, Mrs. Barnaby, we&apos;ll hear your sweetheart&apos;s sentence.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ve just heard mine.
<stage>(ENTER ALAN with crowd. Enter TOM TOM on stage of house)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<stage>(Reading from document)</stage><p>
Hear ye! Hear ye! The Court Royal herewith finds the outlaw,
Alan, guilty of the Master Toymaker&apos;s death and orders that he
be executed in the manner prescribed by law, when found....
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ll do my duty as a good citizen and a relative as well.
There is the criminal!
</p></sp>

<stage>(Tears whiskers from Alan&apos;s face. A general start and
exclamation)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Who is this villain?
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Your unhappy uncle! Take him, he has disgraced me enough.
Now, let the sentence be carried out.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Wait!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Yes, wait!</p>
<stage>(To Barnaby)</stage>
<p>You give me back my whiskers!</p>
<stage>(Tries to seize them)</stage>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<stage>(Reads)</stage><p>
I have not finished. He shall be executed in the manner prescribed
by the law when found--unless he takes advantage of the
law which gives every condemned man the right to plead the
benefit of widow."
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>
Mary and Alan</speaker>
<p>
The benefit of widow?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>An ancient law of Toyland, meant to assist deserving class of
subjects.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>What is the benefit of widow?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Any widow, may claim a condemned man for her second husband,
and he shall be free as long as he supports said widow and
saves her from becoming a charge upon the state.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>And may the victim choose the widow?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Some have preferred the gallows. Do you claim the benefit?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Moves toward Mary)</stage><p>
No, I&apos;ll die rather than marry anybody but Contrary Mary.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<stage>(Grinning)</stage><p>
If you mean Mrs. Barnaby, you&apos;re a little bit late.
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<stage>(Astonished)</stage><p>
You? Mrs. Barnaby?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Alan, he recognized you, but he swore to let you escape if I
married him at once!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ll plead that benefit. Bring on your widows. I&apos;ll marry and
live!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Let the court heralds summon the widows of our city.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<stage>(To Alan)</stage><p>
Courage, somebody will surely choose you.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>It&apos;s so undignified. I feel like a prize at a grab bag party.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Don&apos;t despair, old man, some widow will surely find you
worth taking.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<stage>(Indignantly)</stage><p>
You needn&apos;t speak of him as though he were a marked down
remnant.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>To think that we&apos;re parted forever!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Not forever.
<stage>(Looking at Barnaby)</stage>
The joyful day may soon arrive when they&apos;ll expect me to
wear crape for that!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>A joyful day indeed! I&apos;ll ride with you in the first carriage,
and on the way to the cemetary I&apos;ll propose to you!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barnaby</speaker>
<p>Then here&apos;s where I give up smoking and go in for physical
culture. As soon as I&apos;ve engaged places on the coach, my
dear, we&apos;ll depart upon our honeymoon.
<stage>(EXITS L. chuckling)</stage>
Remember, the sentence will be carried out if a widow does
not choose you in fifteen minutes.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;m liable to be killed in the rush! <stage>(EXIT CHORUS)</stage>
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ll hurry them along.
<stage>(EXITS UP R)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>All right. Tell the widows I&apos;m the latest thing in imported
husbands!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Alan, will you do me a teeny-weeny favor? As you&apos;ve got to
marry in order to live, I wish you&apos;d marry to please me.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>How can I marry somebody else to please you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Don&apos;t marry anybody who&apos;ll make you forget me.
</p></sp>
<stage>
<hi rend="underline">SONG. NO.</hi>
</stage>
<stage>(If required)</stage>

<stage>(If used or not used then continue)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>But remember, if a dashing widow should claim you,
don&apos;t accept.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>No.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>But if one with a bad temper, and a squeaky voice should claim
you, it would make me feel very restful.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>How about me, I need a little rest myself.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Every time you looked at her, I know you&apos;d think of me!
</p></sp>

<stage>(TOM TOM ENTERS RIGHT)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>The merry widows are here, although they are not all so merry.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>Are they pretty?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>They&apos;re a group of dreams.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mary</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ll leave you. Remember, nothing attractive, nothing that will
take me from your thoughts! For one second.
<stage>(EXITS L)</stage>

<pb/>

<stage>(To a strain of MUSIC the WIDOWS ENTER.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Here they are, my boy! Now turn on your best personality.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>If they&apos;re going to propose to me, I won&apos;t know what to say,
except this is all so sudden.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tom</speaker>
<p>Don&apos;t hesitate, girls. The one who speaks first gets him.
<stage>(Xes into Courthouse.)</stage>
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Well, ladies, the auction bargain sale is going to begin. Here
I am, the answer to any widow&apos;s prayer. Will anyone start off
the bidding.
<stage>(Turns to first.)</stage>
How about you, lady?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
1st Widow Woman</speaker><p>
Do you think that all marriages are happy?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>All marriages are happy, it&apos;s the living together after
marriage that causes all the trouble.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
1st Widow</speaker><p>
Before we were married, my husband said he would die for me.
And after marriage he was kind enough to do it!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Ah! Lady Dracula speaking! I hope I don&apos;t get an offer from
you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
2nd Widow</speaker>
<p>
My next husband must be strong, silent, full of grit,
-- able to bear the burden of the day! He will not hear a 
word said about me, and he will utter no unkind word.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>What you want is a deaf and dumb coal heaver!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>3d Widow</speaker>
<p>When I was married I didn&apos;t do as well as I expected.
And to tell you the truth I don&apos;t think he did either.
I&apos;ve been married twice, but I think every widow&apos;s entitled
to her third.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I think you&apos;re frank anyway, and you seem to have an even temper.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>3d Widow</speaker>
<p>Yes, my temper&apos;s even, always the same --very nasty!
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I believe you&apos;re deliberately falsifying it. How did your last
husband happen to die?--
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>3rd Widow</speaker>
<p>
Oh, I suppose he thought it was the best way out!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I hope you don&apos;t claim me.
<stage>(Turns to 4th)</stage>
How about you, lady?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
4th Widow</speaker><p>
The first month I was married, we lived in a bungalow, called
"Ye Lovey Dovey Cot"
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I suppose you changed that afterward to "Ye Battling Arena".
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
5th Widow</speaker><p>
My husband was a dentist with a sense of humor. But he
pulled too many good ones.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>He must have been very easily tickled.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>
5th Widow</speaker><p>
Yes, he was so ticklish, he couldn&apos;t touch his ribs - he had
to have them dry-cleaned. But he left me a large fortune.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Step into my office, I want to talk to you.
<stage>(Takes her aside.)</stage> <stage>(Converses pantomine)</stage>
</p>

<stage>(Widows surround Alan, and he walks to steps, they follow
him)</stage>
<p>
I&apos;ll take all your offers into consideration.
And you may hear from me later. -- But I doubt it.
<stage>(EXITS into court house)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Widow</speaker>

I wonder if he&apos;ll help us.

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Try him.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<stage>(To Alan)</stage><p>
We&apos;re in a very embarrassing position.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>And you only can save us from becoming perfectly ridiculous.
When we start to execute you, everybody is liable to laugh
at us.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I won&apos;t!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>If they find we&apos;re not regular executioners, we&apos;ll lose the
job.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>How can I help you?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Gonzorgo</speaker>
<p>Since you&apos;ve got to leave this cold, hard world, will you
allow us to send you our way?
<stage>(Touching warrant)</stage>
It&apos;ll be so much pleasanter than this.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I&apos;ll go your way.
</p></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<p>Wise boy. Now what would you like in the way of a farewell
luncheon. It&apos;ll be your very last. Have anything you like.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>I&apos;d like a dish of strawberries.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>But strawberries won&apos;t be in season for 6 months!
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>That&apos;s all right, I&apos;ll wait.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>No, now is your time. But I can give you a glass of strawberry
wine.

<sp><speaker>Gon.</speaker>
<p>Just before you start for the scafford...
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>And you&apos;ll go into a dreadless sleep.

<sp><speaker>Alan</speaker>
<p>Go ahead! I haven&apos;t anything to lose. Except my life.

<p>Too bad, too bad. I&apos;m very sorry.
<stage>(ALL turn away from him)</stage>
It was my duty. I had to do it. I really had to...Such
treatment is hard to bear...
<stage>(His eyes fall on the tray with the wine glass)</stage>
Without help. At such a time as this I need encouragement.

Oh! Oh!
