<head><hi rend="underline">ACT ONE</hi></head>
<stage> SCENE: The Elm Alley Inn. A garden restaurant of the Bohemian variety. A large elm tree is growing in the yard and this gives the restaurant its name. There is a balcony built around this tree and stops going up to it. </stage>
<stage> There are a number of little tables in the yard and on a covered terrace at the back that opens on the garden through glass doors, there are more tables. </stage>
<stage>To the right is the rear facade of the house; to the left a high wall covered with lattice. There is a doorway is this wall that opens into the alley. There is lattice work over the other walls, too, and on either side of the terrace frescoed panels with figure subjects. </stage>
<stage>OPENING: At rise there are occupants at most
of the tables. The Inn of Elm Tree
Alley is apparently a favorite resort
of couples whose interest in each
other is so great that they prefer
to be in a place where they won't be subject of remark. Hence the popularity of this little Bohemian resort. There is a party of four at one table and seated alone at another table is ROSIE with her back turned reading a newspaper. She is  waiting for Otis. </stage>
<stage> The proprieter and the WAITER come in with the checks. Business of paying checks. </stage>

JIM&apos;S NUMBER<lb/>
<lb/>
(&quot;IN THE NIGHT TIME&quot;)<lb/></stage>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>The night time, when the lights are bright</l>
<l>It's the night time when we feel just right.</l>
<l>Makes a chappie feel so happy</l>
<l>We're so snappy, we're full of fight.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker> Girls</speaker><lg>
<l>There's something doing.</l>
</lg></sp>
<sp>
<speaker> Jim</speaker><lg>
<l>It's the night walk that we love to prowl</l>
<l>It's the night hawk, that's the wise old owl</l>
<l>Bet your life we have to fall</l>
<l>When the lark is singing gaily</l>
<l>And the sun is overhead</l>
<l>While the world is working daily</l>
<l>We love to lie in bed.</l>
<l>Honest toil may be a treasure</l>
<l>But it has no charm for us.</l>
</lg></sp>
<sp>
<speaker> Girls</speaker><lg>
<l>The night was made - of leisure</l>
<l>Let others fume and fuss</l>
<l>For simple rustic pleasure</l>
<l>We do not care a straw.</l>
</lg></sp>
<sp>
<speaker> Jim</speaker><lg>
<l>We think it's great to stay out late at night</l>
<l>And skate around with Maud and Kate.</l>
</lg></sp>
<sp>
<speaker> Girls</speaker><lg>
<l>We love the boys and all the noise</l>
<l>And lively plays and cabarets.</l>
</lg></sp>

<stage>(For finish of number TWO DANCERS enter... dance with JIM...all exit)</stage>

<stage>(OTIS breezes in carrying hat, coat and big rubber tire. A pretty hatcheck GIRL follows him)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker> Hatcheck Girl</speaker><p> Check your hat and coat, sir? </p></sp>
<pb/>
<sp>
<speaker> Otis</speaker>
<p> Never mind the hat and coat - take my spare tire.</p>
<stage>(He rolls it at her. GIRL takes it and exits)</stage>
<p>I'm too smart for this New York. Now I'm going to roast this town when I get back to Squantanville.</p>
<stage>(WAITER tries to take his coat)</stage>
<p>Elmer - Elmer - come back here!</p>
<stage>(Pulls coat away from waiter)</stage>
<p>I get some bottles there.</p>
<stage>(Shows a couple from pockets)</stage>
<stage>(Replaces bottles. ROSIE enters, sore)</stage>
<p>Ah, glamourpuss, there you are....hello, Rosie.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>I thought you said you'd meet me here at half past seven.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Sorry, honeybun, but I had to see a man about that mink coat
I promised you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Really, Otis? When do I get it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>That's up to Peter and Maizie.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Are they the furriers?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>No. Peter and Maizie are minks - they're a pair of live,
lovely, pedigreed minks. I just bought 'em for you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>What for?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>You said you wanted a mink coat, didn't you? Why pay a
thousand dollars when you can grow your own.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Grow my own. You know how many minks it takes to make a coat.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>You'll be surprised how easy it'll be. Peter and Maizie
are just crazy about each other. What a cutey-pie! I could
set you right up! You're going to be my little passion
flower and I'm going to be your little pay envelope.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>
<hi rend="underline">Little</hi> pay is right.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>That has all the ear marks of a nasty crack. What about
tying on the feed bag? Now go right ahead and order what
you like - You know me, big hearted Otis. You want to be
careful what you're ordering -- they say that this place
is noted for its ptomaine-poisoning.</p>
<stage>(Music plays off stage R.piano and violin)</stage>
<p>Ah, they've got music here. What do you say now? Shall
we trip a measure in the dance while we're waiting for the
waiter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>O.K. Jitterbug. But if you step on my feet just once, I'll
tear you limb from limb.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>What are you saying? Why I was known as the dancing dervish
of Squantanville.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Maybe you go big in those huskin' bees, <hi rend="underline">in the barn</hi>, but in
New York.....</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>There you go --- "New York" again --- I tell you this burg
is <hi rend="underline">slow</hi>. We've got steps up home you folks have never heard
of. How about the frog dip? Or the Malary shiver. Or the
Jelly roll?</p></sp>

<stage>NUMBER 3. "ON WITH THE DANCE".</stage>

<l>I'll show them a step</l>
<l>All ginger and pep,</l>

<l>I'll shimmy and shake,</l>
<l>And I'll twist like a snake,</l>
<l>Till I wriggle clean out of my garters.</l>
<l>I'll find me a maiden so frail,</l>
<l>I'll grab her and prove I'm a whale.</l>

<stage>(ROSIE dances off R.1.E.)</stage>

<stage>(Encore with "VAMP")</stage>

<stage>(During dance with Vamp, ROSIE enters with MAN R.2.E.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<stage>(Stops dancing)**</stage>
<stage>(To Vamp)</stage>
<p>Now you see the evils of dancing.</p>
<stage>(Puts hand on shoulder of Vamp)</stage>
<p>Pardon me. I thought you had a shirt on.</p></sp>
<stage>(ROSIE and MAN dance. OTIS takes her away from him, they dance and exit R.1.E. VAMP and MAN exit L. through gate)</stage>

<stage>(After number "ON WITH THE DANCE" ALL exit)</stage>

<pb/>

<stage>(Music S. in to the entrance music for the SETTLEMENT GIRLS who enter through gate followed by MRS. TEN BROCK)</stage>

<stage>(There are SIX GIRLS and SALLY. They are
all in very cheap clothes - torn, patched.
SALLY is in the middle of the line. POPS
enters from restaurant.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<stage>(Coming forward to R.C.)**</stage>
<p>Good evening.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>Good evening. I am Mrs. Ten Brock - I have been doing
settlement work in the neighborhood. You wrote to our
Matron, saying you wanted a young girl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Yes - to wash dishes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Girls</speaker>
<p>Wash dishes!</p></sp>
<stage>(ALL the GIRLS tip-toe to gate L. and try to crowd out. MRS. TEN BROCK calls to them)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>Girls! Girls!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Girls</speaker>
<p>Yes, ma'am.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>Come back here. Do behave and please turn out your toes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Girls</speaker>
<p>Yes, ma'am!</p></sp>
<stage>(They form an oblique line at L.C. of stage)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>I used to have the Waiters do it, but I've got a fellow now,
that has a grudge against dishes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>I see. Now these are all lovely girls. This is Miss
Schuyler - Miss Bryan, Miss Audubon, and the dark girl is
Miss Plaza.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>My, my what wonderful names they have. Will ladies that
belong to such fine families, really work for me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>They are all foundlings. They were named from the telephone
districts in which they were found. The one on the end is
Miss Green.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Green?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>She was really named Bowling Green, but it seemed rather
long.</p>
<stage>(Spoken)</stage>
<p>They all have their good points.</p></sp>
<stage>(Goes L.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>There's only one point that interests me in a dish-washer -
have they got non-skid hands.</p>
<stage>(Looking them over)</stage>
<stage>(Stops SALLY and the GIRLS exit R.2.E.)</stage>
<p>I like this one. Would you like the job, young lady?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage>(R.)**</stage>
<p>I would not!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<stage>(L.)**</stage>
<p>Why Sally!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage>(Xes to Mrs. Ten Brock)**</stage>
<p>Have <hi rend="underline">you</hi> ever washed dishes?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>Well, I can't say I have.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>I thought not. What else will I have to do?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Oh, just clean out the place, run errands - and so on --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Sew on what - buttons?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>No, no! So on, means anything.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Take me away, Mrs. Ten Brock. I don't want to stay in a 
place, where they ask me to do anything.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>Don't be silly, Sally, Mr. Shendoff is a very nice man.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Have you seen his references?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>You <hi rend="underline">must</hi> be more respectful to your employer.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Now, do you think you could mop up this floor?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>No!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
Mrs. Ten Borck</speaker>
<p>No what, Sally --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>No - mop.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>I'll give you the mop -- Do you want the job?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage>(Xes to R.)**</stage>
<p>I certainly don't -- but I guess I'll have to take it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>Certainly, Ma'am.</p></sp>
<stage>(Exit MRS. TEN BROCK and POPS R.U.E.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage>(S.C.)**</stage>
<p>Other girls get interesting jobs - look at Joan Crawford,
look at Merle Oberon.</p></sp>

<stage>(GIRLS appear in doorway R.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl</speaker>
<p>Sally's a dish-washer -- Sally's a dish-washer.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Gee, if there's one job I hate, it's bathing dishes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>3rd Girl</speaker>
<p>Maybe you'll be a cashier some day.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>I don't want to be any old cashier -- I want to be famous.</p></sp>

<stage>DANCERS ENTER</stage>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl</speaker>
<stage>(Xes to Sally)</stage>
<p>Gee, you're always harping on being famous, you make me tired.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>What's eaten you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>2nd Girl</speaker>
<stage>(Comes down)</stage>
<p>You've got a long way to go girlie.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>That's all right, but I'll get there. Other girls have done
it. Why Joan of Arc didn't start any higher up than I am.</p></sp>

1.</stage>
<sp><lg>
<l>Joan of Arc was on her own,</l>
<l>When she was quite a child;</l>
<l>They thought her head was made of bone,</l>
<l>But she just calmly smiled.</l>
<l>They had their troubles at the time,</l>
<l>And everybody know it;</l>
<l>When Kings and Dukes kept making flukes,</l>
<l>She said, "Here let me do it."</l>
</lg>
<stage>
REFRAIN
</stage>
<lg>
<l>I wish I could be like Joan of Arc,</l>
<l>You bet that girl was through;</l>
<l>They joshed her when she started,</l>
<l>But she never got downhearted</l>
<l>And it shows what a kid can do.</l>
<l>She wrote her name on the nation's roll of fame,</l>
<l>And it gained her great renown;</l>
<l>Though her Pa and Ma poor Fishes,</l>
<l>Tried to keep her washing dishes;</l>
<l>But you can't keep a good girl down.</l>
</lg>
<pb/>
<stage>
2.</stage>
<lg>
<l>She had no stairs to wash</l>
<l>With soap suds and a pail;</l>
<l>She just cut out domestic bosh,</l>
<l>And bought a suit of Mail.</l>
<l>They handed her the icy mitt</l>
<l>But still she was unshaken,</l>
<l>She showed the foe some tricks - yes ho</l>
<l>And soon brought home bacon.</l>
</lg>
<stage>
REFRAIN
</stage>
<lg>
<l>I wish I could be like Joan of Arc,</l>
<l>She was "it" right from the start;</l>
<l>When the hired girl was busy</l>
<l>Well it used to make her dizzy,</l>
<l>So she said "Here's where we part,"</l>
<l>She loved to fight and when foe-men came in</l>
<l>She would hand them Dempsey punches,</l>
<l>Where they used to keep their lunches;</l>
<l>For you can't keep a good girl down.</l>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>What are you looking for? What's all the commotion.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I had a tip on the tray.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>What was it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>A dime.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>A what?</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>A dime. I was looking for it. Maybe it's under your feet?</p>

<p>No, the <hi rend="underline">other</hi> foot?</p>

<p>Now how am I going through life with a thing like that -
there it goes.</p>
<stage>(Gets up)</stage>
<p>I'll have to use some Sloan's liniment.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Is that good?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Certainly it's good. Mix a little orange juice with it --
kills the taste - there it goes.</p>

<p>As though I hadn't had troubles enough.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>I am very sorry, your Highness.</p></sp>

<p>Don't salute,  don't want people to know that the Duke of
Checkergovinia, is a waiter in a third class restaurant.</p></sp>

<p>A third class restaurant?</p>
<stage>(Angry)</stage>
<p>What do you mean, sir --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I'm wrong - I admit it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>I'm glad you do.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>It's not third class. It's a fourth class.</p>
<stage>(Goes to table L.)</stage>
<p>My position and everything's gone from me.</p></sp>

<p>I'm speaking about my social position.</p>

<p>I think <hi rend="underline">I'd</hi> feel better if I smashed something.</p>
<stage>(CONNIE turns)</stage>
<p>Your Highness!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Don't salute. Are you or are you not a loyal supporter
of the ducal family of Pzchekagovinia?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Haven't I proved my loyalty? After you were kicked out
and came to New York penniless and friendless, didn't I
take you in and treat you as one of the family?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Yes -- that's what I'm complaining of. I asked you - are
you - are you not a loyal supporter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Yes, I am!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Give me next Thursday night off!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>I knew it would be something like that! Whenever you start
in about my loyalty I always feels a touch coming. I fire
a <hi rend="underline">good</hi> waiter and engage you out of loyalty and you do
nothing but ask me for days off.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>All right. If I am ever restored I shall give you the order
of the cross of Anastasia -- <hi rend="underline">that</hi> I have promised -- but
you'll never get the order of the golden caterpillar --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Oh <hi rend="underline">please</hi>--your Highness!</p></sp>
<stage>(Salutes)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Don't salute! When do I get off?</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>But where do I get off? I've only got three other waiters--</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<stage>(Pompously)**</stage>
<p>When do I get off?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Next Thursday.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>You may kiss our hand.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Kiss your hand.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<stage>(Taking out engagement book)**</stage>
<p>Pardon me. My thoughts had strayed back to summer days in
dear old Checkergovinia.</p>
<stage>(Makes note in book)</stage>
<p>I shall now be able to accept Mr. Farquar's invitation to
attend the ball, given in my honor.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<stage>(C.)**</stage>
<p>Have none of your friends found out how it is you make your
living?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<stage>(R.)**</stage>
<p>Of course not. I tell them all I must withold my address
for political reasons - owing to the activity of the revolutionists
I am living incog--</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>In what? Where is that? That incog--</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>It's not a place, it's --</p>
<stage>(Stuttering)</stage>
<p>When I say I'm living incog, I mean - I'm living incognito.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Oh, that's so simple!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I know you are. Now you had better come and help me wash
the dishes.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Now, I'm busy.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>You had better come and help me wash the dishes.</p>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Good evening.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Good evening. Table for one.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>No, for eight.</p>
<stage>(Organ plays off L.)</stage>
<p>Waiter, here's a dollar. Won't you please give it to that
organ grinder and ask him to go away?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Certainly, sir.</p>
<stage>(Pockets dollar. Throws plate, comes back rubbing his hands)</stage>
<p>All attended to, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Let me see. I wrote out the menu for supper. Where did I
put it?</p>
<stage>(Feels in his pockets)</stage>
<p>Here it is.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<stage>(Reading)**</stage>
<p>Two young children -- a touch of arsenic -- a --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Oh, excuse me. There are all chapter headings in my novel.
The menu is on the other side.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Celery, olives. Ox tail soup - you're going away back.
I must be careful with that. If I should give it to the
cook wrongside up, there'd be trouble. Imagine a touch of
arsenic. Did I understand you to say you were an author?</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Yes, I write books.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Well, sir -- Do you mind paying for this in advance?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>In advance?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>It is a rule of the house---artists and writers must pay
in advance.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Here is my card--I think the proprietor knows me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>He knows all of you, that's why he made this rule.</p>
<stage>(Reads card)</stage>
<p>Mr. Blair Farquar--Oh, I beg pardon. You are a relative of
the great financier--Richard Farquar, I believe?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>He is my father.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Ah yes! What a coincidence - your father -</p>
<stage>(Sits - then rises)</stage>
<p>Sit down, it's all right. I beg your pardon - my mistake -
your error. Tell me -- are you likely to attend the party
that Mr. Farquar is giving in honor of his Highness the
Grand Duke of Pzchekagovinia?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Not if I can help it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Why not?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>I hear the Duke is an absolute ninny.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Mah! Ha! Ha!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>My friend met him and as Jim puts it, a brain specialist
couldn't make peanut money working on him.</p></sp>

<p>Is that so? You want me to fix this supper for you <hi rend="underline">good</hi>?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Will you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Wait and see.</p></sp>

<stage>(There is a sound of commotion in the alley. VOICES and whoops, cat calls, SALLY runs across stage entering from right and shooting off through gate left)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>What was that that shot across?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>That was the new dishwasher---escaping.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Couldn't stand washing dishes any longer--Really I don't
wonder. Poor kid what an awful way to have to make your
living!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>What about <hi rend="underline">me</hi>?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Ha ha yourself! Why give her all the sympathy. How about me.
She's got gold in her teeth. Gold! I don't even get meat in

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Is that your dog?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Yes. He followed me over here and the kids get hold of him
and tied a tomato can to his tail. Shake hands with the
gentleman Custard.</p></sp>
<stage>(DOG sits up. Shakes hands)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>He's clever, isn't he?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>You bet he is. Knows more than most <hi rend="underline">men</hi>, doesn't he?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Seems to.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>And he minds better too. There -- now go on home.</p></sp>
<stage>(Send dog away)</stage>
<stage>(DOG runs off into wings L.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>You believe in the motto "The more I see of men the more
I think of dogs?"</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Oh men are all right I guess if you're all dolled up and
look pretty.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Nonsense, <hi rend="underline">I'm</hi> a man and fine clothes don't make any difference
to me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Sure; that's what they all <hi rend="underline">say</hi>. But you walk up behind
one of 'em and make a noise like rustlin' silk an' watch
how quick he'll turn around. I've tried it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Have you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>I need to sew sandpaper on the knees of my stockings. The
affect was great but of course as soon as they <hi rend="underline">looked</hi> at me
it was cold.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>What do you do here - wash dishes?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Say, is it beginning to <hi rend="underline">show</hi> on me? I've only had the job
about fifteen minutes and the first person that sees me spots
me for a dish washer.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>No, I didn't. The waiter told me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Oh-h! I feel better. I thought I had dishpan hands.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>How do you <hi rend="underline">like</hi> washing dishes?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Are you trying to be funny? Whoever heard of <hi rend="underline">anyone</hi> that 
<hi rend="underline">liked</hi> washing dishes?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Suppose I could find you a job you liked better.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>If you would find me <hi rend="underline">any</hi> job I <hi rend="underline">didn't</hi> like better you'd be a
wonder!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll see what I can do!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Oh...</p>
<stage>(Stops)</stage>
<p>Will you? ... Say, you're like the man I used to read about
in the story books. I didn't think there was a man like that
in real life.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Are you fond of books?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>I love 'em. They help you to get away from your own life.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>I'm mighty glad to find someone who thinks books really 
<hi rend="underline">useful</hi>. You see, I write stories....</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Do you now? I wonder if you wrote my favorite about the
girl the villain ties to a railroad track because she spurns
his vile love? Did you write that one?</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<stage>(Smiling)**</stage>
<p>No, that isn't one of mine.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>No?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker><p>
<hi rend="underline">No.</hi></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage>(Disappointed)**</stage>
<p>Too bad. The hero of that one seemed a lot like you --
only of course he wouldn't have gone around in the evenin'
without a full dress-suit.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>

<p>What's your name?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Blair--that's a funny name. Which end do you use it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>

<p>Oh, I'm pretty good.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>We're going to be friends, you and I.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Are we?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Don't you want to be? I do. I'm rather lonely sort of

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Do you---really?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>And I'm going to help you if you'll let me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>It's awful good of you! I thought I was playing in hard
luck when they picked me out to wash dishes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Well, it's a long story. I used to be in politics.</p></sp>

<p>Gee, that's not much better than waiting. If I were a man

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>No. With that high knee action of yours you got me between

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>You used to say you could die dancing with me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>And boy! Did I come close tonight!</p>
<stage>(Sits)</stage>
<p>Now what's this about some money you're going to make?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>That's right, dream toots. Today I clinched a deal by which

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Yeah, I'll bet.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Cross my heart.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>What heart?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Don't change the subject. I'm going to get one thousand
bucks for booking the famous and notorious Russian Madam
Nockerova to appear next Thursday at a big ball given by

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>I'm not acquainted with her! I'm her agent. Her New York
representative. I picked this paper up outside and the first
thing I struck right here on the first page Mme. Nockerova
wrecks the throne of a Grand Duke.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>A bomb-thrower?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>A bomb-thrower, nonsense. She don't have to throw bombs,
with a face like that! Look at that face. No, not that
one- that's Sophie Tucker. This one -</p>
<stage>(Points)</stage>
<p>She's only a little bit of a woman, but the damage she can
do!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>I'll bet that's just press-stuff. She's probably a perfectly
nice girl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Here, what are you trying to do, ruin her reputation.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>I s'pose you think that a girl can't be on the stage and

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Say, what the --- That's the freshest waiter I ever saw.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Welcome, Brother Elk.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<stage>(Showing lapel of coat)**</stage>
<p>Kansas City 74.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<stage>(Some business)**</stage>
<p>St. Louis 49.</p>
<stage>(Start toward each other to shake hands. Miss)</stage>
<p>Where has he gone? You want a regular dinner?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Not me. I want a footbath and some linament.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>That's a la carte.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>What would you recommend, waiter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>The food in Childs.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>I'd like some broth.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Some broth, yes, Miss.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>I'd like some mutton.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Mutton broth.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>No. Mutt and Jeff.</p>
<stage>(Laugh business. OTIS pushes CONNIE. He sinks to floor. Rings bell)</stage>
<p>Waiter! Waiter!</p>
<stage>(Turning to right - then left. CONNIE dodging to right then left. Rises)</stage>
<p>I wish you'd light in one place.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Here I am, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>

<p>Oh, oh.</p>
<stage>(THEY help him up)</stage>
<p>I wish you'd call your shots. Get me a bottle of whiskey.</p>
<stage>(Takes it form hip pocket)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>O.K. with three glasses.</p>
<stage>(Brings bottle and glasses)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Three glasses?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<stage>(Pouring)**</stage>
<p>That's right.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>You'll do nothing of the kind. You'll get <hi rend="underline">two</hi> glasses.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Why, aren't you drinking?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<stage>(Grabbing bottle from him)**</stage>
<p>He's the freshest waiter I ever saw!</p>
<stage>(To Rosie)</stage>
<p>Do you care if I smoke?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>I don't care if you burn.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Hey, waiter, I wish you'd give us a little service.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I'll give you as little as I can.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Well make this dinner good and snappy. Bring me a dozen clams.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Twelve clams. Will the lady be sitting with you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Why certainly.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>That's all I want to know. I don't need thirteen at the
table. Twelve clams.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Rosie ain't he the character?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>May I make a suggestion?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Why not, I'm broad-minded.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>How would you like some oysters?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>No. Oysters aren't good this month.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll give you last month's.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Chum, I hope your food is better than your jokes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>You wouldn't dare say that if I were a woman.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Shut up and take the order! Ya crumb!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Oh, a Vassar girl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>And waiter after you have eased in here with the clams, you
might bring us a couple of bowls of "soups".</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Yes sir.</p>
<stage>(Starts to go then back to Otis)</stage>
<p>Beg pardon, sir, what was that last?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>I said you might glide in here with a couple of bowls of
"soups".</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<stage>(With face near Otis)**</stage>
<p>Zoupe?</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Zoupe!</p>
<stage>(At same time turning face to Connie. THEY kiss. CONNIE pulls lemon out of pocket eats it. OTIS wipes his mouth with tablecloth, then match bus. Rings bell)</stage>
<p>Waiter! Waiter!</p>
<stage>(CONNIE rushes madly in different  directions then back to table)</stage>
<p>I wish you would give us a little attention, but don't be
so darned affectionate.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Did you say "zoupe"?</p></sp>
<stage>(THEY look at each other. BOTH put napkins over heads)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Zoupe. Then I think I'd like some fish.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<stage>(Hits him over head with order book)**</stage>
<p>Now that's enough.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<stage>(In a daze)**</stage>
<p>Rosie, I wish you wouldn't play so rough.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>I didn't do it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I wish you wouldn't order fish.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis and Rosie</speaker>
<p>Why not?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Isn't it fresh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Certainly, it's fresh, we have an aquarium right on the
premises.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Why if you've got an aquarium on the premises, the fish are
bound to be fresh.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>And I am in charge of the aquarium.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Then you might dig in and bring us out a couple of fat ones.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I watched the little fish grow from girlhood up. Pardon me,
there's your arm.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>What!</p></sp>
<stage>(Adlib)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>It was hanging from your shoulder. I wish you wouldn't order
fish. I've become attached to them.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<stage>(Rises)**</stage>
<p>I understand your feeling. You've probably become so fond
of them that you've spoiled them and I hate spoiled fish.
However, waiter, I can appreciate your sentiments. I can
understand how anyone can really grow fond of a fish. You
know Rosie, that takes me back to Squantanville. When I was
a boy. Ah me, heigho, alackaday! <hi rend="underline">I</hi> had a pet fish! I called
her Isabelle. I was awfully fond of Isabelle, taught her a
lot of tricks--even taught her to do without water.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>What!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>There's nothing strange about that. Is there, Waiter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Oh, no.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>I got Isabelle so used to going without water, I could keep
her in the cage with the canary bird.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>The fish!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Yes, the fish. One evening, ah me, fateful night! How well
I remember it...Isabelle was in the canary bird's cage
romping around. Leaping from crag to crag like a mountain
goat.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>The fish!</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>The fish! Then she got upon the canary bird's perch.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>With the other fish.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>No.</p></sp>
<stage>(Rises, walks to and fro)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Well, a perch is a fish.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>You leather-head. She got on the canary bird's swing.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Oh! I give up!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<stage>(Bus. exasperated)**</stage>
<p>Listen, she got up in the canary bird's swing...and was
swinging blithely to and fro--when she lost her balance,
fell into the canary bird's bath and was drowned.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>The fish?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>The fish.</p>
<stage>(CONNIE attempts to strike Otis. OTIS jumps up also ROSIE. OTIS behind Rosie)</stage>
<p>All right Rosie. I'm right behind you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I can sympathize with you, sir, for I too have had a great
sorrow in my life.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Yes, it's showing on you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Olga was her name.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Oh, a Russian girl?</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>A hen. A barn yard person. I taught her to lay colored 
Easter eggs.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>The fish.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Then hen....by holding a piece of red and blue cloth in front
of her eyes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Of course - prenatal influence.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Thank you. I wish, but one day I went out to visit with
my little Olga and found her dead.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Dead?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Yes. Some darn fool had hung a patchwork quilt in front
of her.</p></sp>
<stage>(Exit)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>We've been listening to that darn fool and he's gone without
taking our order. Come on, Rosie, let's have a dance while
we're waiting.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>O.K. But remember one thing, will ya?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>What's that?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Your dancing <hi rend="underline">with</hi> me - not <hi rend="underline">at</hi> me!</p></sp>
<stage>(Exit OTIS and ROSIE)</stage>

<stage>(Enter BLAIR, JIM and BOYS. General conversation as THEY enter, as tho continuing a conversation.)</stage>

Boys</speaker>

</sp>
<sp><speaker>Jim</speaker>
<p>And you want to help her?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Yes, but I don't quite know how.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jim</speaker>
<p>Hey, you sound in a bad way, Blair.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Don't be ridiculous. I only met here an hour ago.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jim</speaker>
<p>Yes, I know. But time has nothing to do with love.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>I guess you're right. They say when you meet the girl,
something ups and says "This is it, Brother."</p></sp>

<stage>(To Otis)</stage>
<p>You're wanted on the phone.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I've been hiding it for you.</p></sp>

<p>Can you beat that for tough luck. Now my whole evening is

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>That female snake! That Russian homewrecker - Hello?</p>
<stage>(Shakes hands with Connie)</stage>
<p>You're getting on my nerves. You're a mental cripple. You
ought to go around with a crutch under your chin. Can you
imagine, after all the trouble I took to book that woman,
now she isn't coming -- turning down the whole U.S. for a pinhead
of a Duke. But why should I confide in you? Come on

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I'll have to cook them here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>What's that book?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Fanny Farmer's Cook Book. I'm not quite sure how you mix
these things.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>Well, go ahead, I'm going to watch you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Well, first you take an egg and you drop that in. Then you
take two pieces of bread and butter.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>What for?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>You'll find out. Then add a little seasoning.</p></sp>
<stage>(Pours in everything)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>What's that for?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>You know what vitamins are for, don't you?</p></sp>

<p>Huh?</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I said you know what vitamins are for?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Well, this is ketchup. When the egg is done, you put it between
the bread and there you are crepe suzette.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>That's not a crepe suzette that's an egg sandwich.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>By you it's an egg sandwich, by me it's crepe suzette.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>I won't eat it. This is an outrage. I tell you I won't
eat it!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>What? After me slaving over a hot oven all day, you won't
eat it? Then you can wear it.</p></sp>

<p>Ah, I want a red one.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Never mind the red one here's the bad news.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>76 dollars! That's exorbitant.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>That's a mistake. It should be 96.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>I'd love to go and dance for a lot of society folk and see
a real party.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>That's just what you're going to do.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>But where'll I get the clothes?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Don't worry about that. Nockerova hasn't sailed, but her
trunks have.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>But how will I look in her clothes?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>You'll look slicker than a sink. All you need is a little
dolling-up.</p>
<stage>(Takes Rosie's opera cloak and throws it over Sally)</stage>
<p>Here give me that cape, let me fix your hair.</p>
<stage>(Puts feathers in hair)</stage>
<p>Mother taught me to pluck chickens up in Squantanville and

You're wonderful Sally. What a riot you'll be at the Ball.

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Settlement work?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, Mr. Farquar - you see the Mme. doesn't understand
English very well. Settlement work, she's -- a bill collector.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<stage>(Haughtily)**</stage>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>

<p>Don't remember!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Farquar</speaker>
<p>Does she say she doesn't remember!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Not at all -- merely a case of resemblance and you know --</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Zey shot each other but were zey both killed, Otees?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Well kid -- Madame, I don't quite recall, but it took one
of them, quite a while to heal up. I don't think it did them
any good.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage>(Shrugs)**</stage>
<p>But, why bothair? Zere are so many men. And what good is
a Vice-president anyway?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Oh Lady, burn my clothes. She says the cutest things...
You know Mrs. Tea Spot - no - well - all right - let it go!</p></sp>

<p>Oh yes, I am very domestique. You would nevair guess it to

<sp><speaker>Farquar</speaker>
<p>May I say I think that adds to your charm.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<stage>(Triumphantly)**</stage>

<stage>(OTIS groans)</stage>
<p>
Now I know who it is -- You remind me of -- You look very

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Really? How -- how strange!</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Not at all -- merely a case of resemblance and you know
resemblance is resemblance. See how one grape fruit resembles
another.</p>
<stage>(Looks at her)</stage>
<p>All right, let it go.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Farquar</speaker>
<p>Mr. Hooper, I wonder if you won't go and see that Madame's
maid is properly taken care of.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Mr. Farquar, I'll do that little thing for you, but I don't
quite like to leave her alone -- She might get into mischief.

<p>Ladies, for the past two weeks, I have been waiting, waiting

orders -- and tonight <hi rend="underline">I</hi> am going to sit at the table to dine..</p></sp>

<stage>(THEY turn as if they'd come on just ahead of CONNIE who follows them on, the POOR GIRLS, hanging around him. He is in the uniform of Pzchekagovinian Army. The TWO FLUNKEYS follow. One carrying tray with liquors, the other a tray with coffee. They place these on a table and retire)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Girl</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>You may have it.</p>

<p>No, I haven't.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>

<p>Know her? She's the cause of all my trouble. I fell in love
with her. For her I pawned the crowned jewels and bought her
a pearl necklace.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jim</speaker>
<p>There was a sandal of course.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Scandal! In less than a week I was playing tag around the

<p>Not at all. I <hi rend="underline">want</hi> to meet her. There are several little
things I want to say to her.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jim</speaker>
<p>You say she was visiting the court at the time of the
revolution?</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Yes - she was in the palace the time the revolutionists broke
in. It was she who nudged -- she called me at the first
alarm too late -- she seized the pearl necklace and swam the
Schnitze-Komiski.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Ten Brock</speaker>
<p>The What?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>The Schnitze-Komiski.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jim</speaker>

<p>You may. Oh, I see - you're asking. Why that's our

<l>I'm a Duke from a wonderful clime</l>

<l>In the night they may rouse and chase you.</l>
<l>And prod you with bay-nets like me;</l>
<l>If you meet with defeat</l>
<l>They'll cut off your retreat</l>
<l>Where the Schnitz flows down to the sea.</l>

2nd Verse

<l>Our Sundays are dismals and blue</l>
<l>The same as they're wishing on you;</l>
<l>To ride on a train is a ten dollar fine</l>

<l>When we dine we can just swim in wine</l>
<l>So come on girls fore gather with me;</l>

3rd Refrain

<l>On the banks of the Schnitze Komiski</l>
<l>They're going to close everything down</l>
<l>Cabarets - they will nail up the doors</l>
<l>And they'll shut every theatre in town.</l>
<l>Making love they will stop very soon</l>
<l>No amusements at all there will be</l>
<l>Even children I hear</l>

<stage>(Startling)**</stage>
<p>What are <hi rend="underline">you</hi> doing here?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>I'm on the track of a kid-napper! A fellow has gone and
stole away my little Sally - the finest dish-washer I ever
had --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Well I'm not the fellow --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>I know who the fellar is all right. It's that country-chap
that ain't never stopped talkin' about himself since the
minute he heard the doctor say: "It's a boy!"</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I know him. Zoupe!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>It ain't only because of the dish-washin! Sally's a nice girl.
I like her and the lady at the settlement told me to look
after her.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>But why come after me?</p></sp>
<stage>(His face puckers)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>I didn't come after <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. This fellar's here too --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>You mean he's here at my party?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Yes. I've traced him right to this place. And when I catch
him. I'll just go up to him and say: "Look here you
loafer - what do you mean acting like this?"</p></sp>
<stage>(Starts pushing Connie around)</stage>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<stage> (Con't)</stage>
<p>
And if he hasn't a good answer I'm going to take him by the
neck. A nice fellow to have around by the neck. You I'm
going to say: "You're a low-down good-for-nothing kid snapper--"</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Stop it! You are liable to miss.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>And then if he gets fresh I'll give him a good kick.</p></sp>
<stage>(Illustrates with knee chasing CONNIE around stage)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>There it goes. You'll have to stop eating raw meat.</p>
<stage>(Runs around in a circle, then stops. Bell rings, starts again and stops R. front)</stage>
<p>Who won?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Won? Won what?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>Isn't this some game we're playing? My dear Shendoff - you've
got the wrong idea. You should never forget that you're a
Checkergovinian - you should never lose your temper, be more
tactful, more diplomatic. You should approach him and say:
"My dear Mr. Hooper -- "</p></sp>

<p>Oh, pardon me. This is one of my loyal supporters. I was
just greeting him according to our quaint Pzchekagovinian

<p>How do you do?</p></sp>
<stage>(Bows)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Farquar</speaker>
<p>Go in and ask one of the footmen to give you a glass of wine,
my man. You would no doubt wish to drink the Duke's health.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pops</speaker>
<p>Oh yes - I would like to make several wishes about the Duke's
health!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Farquar</speaker>

Sally, you look beautiful, but why Nockerova? Why didn't
you tell me this before?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>I can't explain but you've always been so nice to me. You
won't give me away will you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Did you find Sally?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>I did, and everything is all right. She and the Duke are as
friendly as Park and Wilford.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Then we have nothing to worry about.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Not a thing. I've got <hi rend="underline">more</hi> good news for you. Sally's
singing here tonight, and I know she's going to make a great
success; and if she does, I've got a chance of getting her
a contract with the Follies.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Say, if you do that you'll make some heavy commissions. An'
if you do that I think I'll marry you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>You'll marry me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Yeah!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>You'll have to give me a little time to think that over.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>No I won't! I've made up our minds you're going to marry me.</p></sp>

<p>What!!!!!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Er---ah---I don't like you that way---I like you but not

did you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>No.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Come on! Get it up! Expect me to buy my engagement ring.
You cheapskate!!!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>I guess I can afford fifteen dollars.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Now all you got to do is pay ten dollars a week for the next

<p>Do you think I'll make you happy, Rosie?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>You'd better. Oh, sure. Sure. You're lousy to look at but
you're all mine. I guess I'm the only dame in the world dumb

<p>Yes, this is Mme. Nockerova -- those pearls she is wearing

she swam away!</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Farquar</speaker>
<p>Then she is Mme. N --</p></sp>

<l>You fled along my balcony</l>

knows I'm not really Nockerova.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Omnes</speaker>
<p>
What!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Mr. Shendoff was right. I did wash dishes in his restaurant.
And now that you know this if you want me to stay, I will.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Farquar</speaker>
<p>I thank you. But I think you had better leave.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>

<p>Oh, I see! As long as you thought I was this terrible woman
you were crazy about me - but now you're not interested in
me any more! I'm not good enough for you and your guests.</p></sp>

<stage>(Note: he tears cards and replaces them with his own card)</stage>

<stage>(ROSIE enters L. door watches him)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>What are you doing?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<stage>(Starts)**</stage>
<p>What's all the shootin' for? - Hello Rosie. I'm just putting
my card on some of these flowers.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>You've got a nerve!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>These are from gang of fellows Sally met at the Farquar
party. I didn't like them anyway.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Wasn't the ballet wonderful, Otis?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>You bet. If success was water, I'd be Niagara Falls.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>You? What did you have to do with it?</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Everything. I got her this contract with the Follies,
didn't I?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>I'll make a fortune out of Sally, and I'll lay it at your feet.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<p>A large fortune?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>It'll look large beside those tiny feet.</p>
<stage>(Laughs)</stage>
<p>Oh, boy, that's a slicker.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rosie</speaker>
<stage>(Xes to R.)**</stage>
<p>Father won't let me marry you, unless you can support me
properly.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Otis</speaker>
<p>Well, I can start you on bread and milk, the same as he did.</p></sp>
<stage>(BOTH exit R. door)</stage>

<stage>(Enter BOYS, carrying SALLY - place her on sofa, group around her)</stage>

<sp><speaker>1st Man</speaker>
<stage>(As they enter)</stage>
<p>What's the matter with Sally Green?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Men</speaker>
<stage>(All)</stage>
<p>She's all right!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Man</speaker>
<p>Who's all right?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Men</speaker>
<p><hi rend="underline">Sally</hi>! Three cheers. Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage>(Standing on chair)**</stage>
<p>Boys, you're all of you wonderfully kind and I want to thank
you. I only wish I was the Duke, so that I could decorate you
with orders.</p></sp>
<stage>(Throwing roses to BOYS who start and exit)</stage>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Men</speaker>
<stage>(As she hands them the bunch of flowers)</stage>
<p>Oh, thank you, Sally! You're wonderful! I'm going to press
this and keep it forever, etc.</p>
<stage>(THEY ALL exit as they get their flowers)</stage>
<p>Good luck, Sally! We're strong for you, you know that, don't
you, etc?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage>(They are all off. She starts to look among the flowers)**</stage>
<p>Oh, dear -- he hasn't even come to see me. And he hasn't
sent me any flowers. They all seem to be from Otis Hooper.</p>
<stage>(Knock at door)</stage>
<p>Ah!</p>
<stage>(She turns expectantly)</stage>
<p>Come in!</p>
<stage>(Enter CONNIE)</stage>
<p>Oh!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>You look disappointed. Were you expecting Blair?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Blair wrote me two letters asking me to forgive him - but I
wrote back saying I never wanted to see him again - He has
never answered my letter or been to see me. Men are so stupid.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I'm very happy tonight because you made such a wonderful
success. You looked charming! I knew you could do it. Oh,
see what I've brought you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Thank you, Connie.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>They're not from me. This note goes with them.</p>

<stage>(SALLY takes it and opens it)</stage>
<p>
It seems quite like my old waiting days carrying notes to
ladies, I'm not waiting any more. I'm going to be married.
I beg your pardon - Yes, to Mrs. Ten Brock that very tall
lady. We haven't settled yet, when the ceremony is going to
take place. She'll make a good wife - so easy to find in a
crowd.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage>(Looking up from her note)**</stage>
<p>He says after the way he behaved at his uncle's party he hasn't
dared to speak to me - but some day when I forgive him, if I
ever do - I am to send him one of these flowers.</p></sp>

<stage>(MAID enters)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>How does he figure you're going to keep them? After three
or four days they don't smell so pretty - of course, you might
press it in your album.</p>
<stage>(Takes flower, (wild rose), she is holding out to him)</stage>
<p>Ah, you want me to take it <hi rend="underline">now</hi>?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>If you can find him.</p>
<stage>(She steps behind screen)</stage>
<p>Excuse me, Connie. I must change my clothes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<stage>(Opening door)**</stage>
<p>I shall search most diligently. It may take a week or a month.
But I'll find him. I'll now go and search.</p>
<stage>(He motions to BLAIR to come to him, hands him rose)</stage>
<p>Sally, supposing I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> find Blair. Shall I tell him you forgive
him?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage>(From behind the screen)**</stage>
<p>No, no, don't do <hi rend="underline">that</hi>. I'm going to make him ask me a lot
of times before I forgive him.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Connie</speaker>
<p>I see. You don't want him to think you were just waiting for
him to come around.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>That's it exactly - and Connie!</p></sp>

<stage>(CONNIE signals to Blair laying his  finger on his lips and pussy-fotts out of the room. He turns at the door and grins)</stage>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<stage> (Con't)</stage>
<p>
CONNIE!</p>
<stage>(Exit CONNIE. SALLY mounts on chair looking over top of screen)</stage>
<p>Why Blair!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>Sally dear!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>Oh, that's not fair!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>But you <hi rend="underline">have</hi> forgiven me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<p>I haven't said so. Your feeling for me is only fatherly.
It's Nockerova that you really love!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<p>It's <hi rend="underline">you</hi> whatever name you're called. Will you marry me?</p>
<stage>(SALLY shakes head "No" then "Yes")</stage>
<p>That's wonderful! We're going to that --</p></sp>

<stage>(REPRISE)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Blair and Sally</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Dear little, dear little church round the corner</l>
<l>We'll slip there one day on the sly;</l>
</lg></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker><lg>
<l>We don't want a fuss, nothing gaudy for us</l>
<l>We have quite settled that, you and I.</l>
</lg></sp>

<sp><speaker>Blair</speaker>
<lg>
<l>She's a girl so it's no use to warn her.</l></lg></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sally</speaker>
<lg><l>He's a boy and so he doesn't care.</l></lg></sp>

<sp><speaker>
Both</speaker>
<lg>
<l>In our hearts we shall sing,</l>
<l>And the joy-bells shall ring</l>
<l>At the church round the corner</l>
<l>It's just round the corner</l>
<l>The corner of Madison Square.</l>
</lg>

<stage>(Shutter closes - curtains follow. Six
flower girls enter from R. and L. strewing
wild roses about stage, when last
