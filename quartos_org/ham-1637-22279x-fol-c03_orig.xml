<l>Bear&#x0027;t that th&#x0027;opposer may beware of thee:</l>
<l>Give every man thy eare, but few thy voice;</l>
<l>Take each mans censure, but reserve thy judgement:</l>
<l>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</l>
<l>But not exprest in fancy; rich, not gaudy;</l>
<l>For the apparell oft proclaimes the man,</l>
<l>And they in <hi rend="italic">France</hi> of the best ranke and station,</l>
<l>Are of a most select and generous, chiefe in that:</l>

<l>For inthat sleep of death what dreames may come,</l>
<l>When we have shuffled off this mortall coyle</l>
<l>Must give us pause, there&#x0027;s the respect</l>
<l>That makes calamity of so long life:</l>
<l>For who would beare the whips and scornes of time,</l>
<l>Th&#x0027;oppressors wrong, the proud mans contumely,</l>
<l>The pangs of despised love, and the Lawes delay,</l>
<l>The insolence of office, and the spurnes</l>
<l>That patient merit of th&#x0027;unworthy takes,</l>
<l>When as himselfe might his <hi rend="italic">Quietus</hi> make</l>
<l>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels beare,</l>

<l>But that the dread of something after death,</l>
<l>The undiscover&#x0027;d Countrey, from whose borne</l>
<l>No traveller returnes, puzzels the will</l>
<l>And makes us rather beare those ills we have,</l>
<l>Than flye to others that we know not of.</l>
<l>Thus conscience does make cowards,</l>
<l>And thus the native hiew of resolution</l>
